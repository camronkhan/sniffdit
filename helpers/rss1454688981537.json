(Photo by Karen Dibert)</p></div>\n<p>My dad has been concerned about mom for a while. She just seemed to lose a bit of interest in life. When they married, they moved in with Dad’s parents on the family farm, and while each family had their own half of a house (with separate kitchens), Mom ended up taking care of her in-laws in their senior years. Mom was very hands-on in raising grandkids, too. She lives to be needed. At her current life stage, she&#8217;s not needed as much. In her boredom, she brought one of the barn cats inside for a pet, cut a hole in a screen window so that he could come and go as he pleased, and pampered him well. Unfortunately, she lost this cat to cancer just before Thanksgiving last year.</p>\n<p>Dad and I decided that mom needed a dog. A dog would force her to get up off the couch and be active, and she could take a dog with her to their cabin. I mentioned as much to mom, and she was adamant that she did not want a dog, mostly for the reasons we thought she needed one. She would have to take the dog outside all the time and would have to get someone to dog sit when they went to the cabin. I told Dad I’d get her one anyway, and while he recognized that it would be more work for him up front, it was the best thing for Mom. He also wished me good luck with the gifting.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343054\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343054 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31121137/22-trixie-3-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"22 trixie 3\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trixie. (Photo by Karen Dibert)</p></div>\n<p>I talked this idea over with my own family, of course. What would Mom say? How would she react? What if she absolutely refused to keep the dog? We decided that whatever dog we chose for Mom would have a permanent home with us. It wasn’t fair to rescue a dog only to put her back into a shelter.</p>\n<p>We live in a rural area, and most dogs in the shelter are big dogs. Mom needed a small lap dog to snuggle with on the couch for hours on end. She needed one she could pick up and carry easily. She needed an adult who was housebroken and wouldn’t eat their slippers. Surprisingly, this was tough to find. I searched rescues and shelters, and found that the cost of adopting a dog was sometimes more expensive than buying a purebred. I was deterred by adult dogs who didn&#8217;t get along well with children or didn&#8217;t like men. And then I found Trixie at the local humane society.</p>\n<p>Trixie was rescued from a home with more than 80 dogs inside. We are guessing that she didn&#8217;t have contact with humans, but was rather allowed to live a feral life inside the home. She was at the shelter a month before she was deemed adoptable, and in that month she was in therapy to become a normal dog. At the time we adopted her, she would allow herself to be petted, but would tremble all over in fear. Trixie needed a lot of love in a quiet environment. Mom needed someone to need her. The two were a perfect match.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343058\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343058 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31121330/trixie-600x429.jpg\" alt=\"trixie\" width=\"600\" height=\"429\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trixie loves the snow, according to Mom. (Photo by Karen Dibert)</p></div>\n<p>My kids and I purchased dog dishes, a collar and leash, a bag of dog food, and some treats and toys, and we delivered them, along with Trixie, to my parents&#8217; house. Mom was less than enthusiastic, as I knew she&#8217;d be, but I asked her to give the dog a month as a trial. I assured her that we&#8217;d keep Trixie if she decided she just couldn&#8217;t keep her.</p>\n<p>The morning after, Mom called to ask why she wasn&#8217;t eating and what she should do about it. We talked about how she was probably just afraid because of the big change in environment and the new people, and to just give her time. Mom went into &#8220;someone needs me&#8221; mode and cooked Trixie hamburger and rice. Unfortunately, she fed her too much and messes ensued, but after two days of not going to the bathroom at all, Mom was at least glad the dog&#8217;s bowels worked. Mom had a mission, and that was to get Trixie to eat dog food and pass house training.</p>\n<p>I started getting daily calls from both Mom and Dad with updates on what Trixie was doing. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t like peanut butter treats, but loves soft chews.&#8221; Within a few days, Dad called to say that Trixie follows Mom all over the house, but is still afraid of him. I now know that Trixie likes to sleep on top of baskets full of laundry, drops kibble into her water bowl to soften it, and peed outside for the first time within three days. And while she&#8217;s absolutely terrified of Dad (who is the kindest and most gentle man ever), she won&#8217;t bite when he picks her up, despite being so afraid that she trembles.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343056\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343056 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31121324/dad-with-trixie-600x900.jpg\" alt=\"dad with trixie\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dad has a mission, too. Trixie now eats treats from his hand after going outside with him. (Photo by Karen Dibert)</p></div>\n<p>Mom and Dad had photos taken with Trixie for their Christmas card. It was a collage of three photos; one of the three of them, one of just Trixie, and one of a granddaughter with Trixie. The first time Trixie went to their cabin, she became car sick during the hour-long drive. She then ran up and down the stairs to the loft and wriggled in glee. I gave mom advice on medication for car sickness, and rejoiced that Trixie loved the cabin.</p>\n<p>I no longer get daily updates regarding Trixie&#8217;s behavior or preferences, and I&#8217;m a little sad about that. I have to make a point to call and ask, but Mom won&#8217;t stop talking about her dog when I bring up the subject. Trixie has made Mom feel needed again. As I was talking to her the other week, she said she needed to apologize to me. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I wasn&#8217;t excited when you gave me the dog.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343055\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343055 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31121153/22-trixie-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"22 trixie\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trixie loves stuffed animals and things with squeakers. (Photo by Karen Dibert)</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;Mom, I know you didn&#8217;t want one. I didn&#8217;t expect you to be excited. I just knew you needed one,&#8221; I replied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved a project, and poor Trixie needs someone to love her. She&#8217;s still timid, but I&#8217;m patient. She&#8217;s a perfect fit. Thank you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not smart to gift pets, but if you do, it&#8217;s important to know the person, the pet, and the situation. Trixie and Mom were meant for each other, and I&#8217;m so glad I was able to be a part of making that happen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em><span class=\"s1\">Read more by </span> Karen Dibert:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\">Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-my-dogs-gained-weight-on-a-healthy-all-natural-dog-food\">Why My Dogs Gained Weight on a Healthy, All-Natural Dog Food</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/22-signs-that-you-might-be-a-helicopter-pet-parent\">22 Signs That You Might Be a Helicopter Pet Parent</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Karen Dibert is a wife, mom, and dog lover living in the Laurel Highlands of Pennsylvania.

              "<p>Spouses can mirror one another in many different ways. My husband and I, for example, both inherited a fairly frugal, non-fancy nature from our respective families. When in a spontaneous-purchase situation, we employ a disciplined wait-and-see strategy. Specifically, we force ourselves to name three reasons why we really, <em>really</em> need this thing. Then we make ourselves wait until the emotional impulse wears off (OK, way easier said than done), and consider the logic of our responses.</p>\n<p>In most cases, this tactic has helped us resist purchasing many nifty-though-not-necessarily-necessary items. It’s also translated into life hacks that allow us to achieve measurable results with our furry family members minus the huge time investments and hefty price tags. When it comes to our canines, we like to put available resources toward whole, healthy nutrition and dietary options proven to support wellness. After all, glossy product packaging and bright, dazzling colors don’t really impress our pups.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are some of our “habitat hacks.” Maybe they’ll help you save time and money, too.</p>\n<h3>1. Challenge: Food bolting</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_341373\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341373 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18112534/Muffin-Tin-600x510.jpg\" alt=\"Muffin-Tin\" width=\"600\" height=\"510\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Whether you prefer to feed wet or dry food, a muffin tin can help ravenous pups curb their food-bolting tendencies. (Photo by Marybeth Bittel)</p></div>\n<p>In recent years, we’ve seen an increasing range of innovative food bowls for this — one of which kinda looks like a <a title=\"Company of Animals Interactive Pet Feeder\" href=\"http://www.companyofanimals.us/products/interactive-feeders\" target=\"_blank\">plastic patch of Astroturf</a>. The idea is to create an in-bowl obstacle that makes <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-health-food-eats-eating-too-fast\" target=\"_blank\">your pup work harder for each individual morsel of food</a>. We’ve achieved similar success putting kibble in a humble angel-food cake pan. Once, when that pan was in the dishwasher, I used a regular-sized muffin tin with good results. And if you’re really just not that into baking, grab one or two standard tennis balls and place them in your pup’s food bowl. They’re the perfect size to “interrupt” the inhalation cycle … yet too large to swallow.</p>\n<h3>2. Challenge: Paw protection</h3>\n<p>Confession: I’m not a big fan of dog booties. They prevent full-paw contact with the ground, which is why most pups begin to walk like the Tin Man having a conniption fit. However, I certainly agree that when the weather gets frigid, many dogs need an extra layer of protection. My own pup Maizy won’t even set foot outside the house when it feels cold and blustery, and I can’t say that I blame her. But boots? She invests every ounce of energy toward trying to shake them off. The same often holds true for bandages that help protect paw injuries.</p>\n<p>How do you help these items stay on securely in the snow and slush? Believe it or not, my vet suggested cling wrap &#8230; and yeah, okay, I gave it a try. Turns out, you can wrap gauze, bulky bandages, or even high-fashion booties with a layer of this kitchen supply. The plastic sticks directly to itself, so it won’t hurt your pooch. And it seals out freezing sleet and moisture long enough for a quick potty run in the winter.</p>\n<h3>3. Challenge: Carpet cleaning</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_343613\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343613 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/03094549/shutterstock_181136756-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Man cleaning carpet by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gentle detergents often contain the same basic enzymes as more expensive pet products. Read the labels, then simply dilute to create your own &#8230; ahem, solution. (<a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-181136756/stock-photo-cleaning-and-home-concept-close-up-of-male-cleaning-stain-on-carpet-with-cloth.html?src=zN3nrZuI8mkGqfBkjBOu1Q-1-71\">Man cleaning carpet</a> by Shutterstock)</p></div>\n<p>When you’re a pet owner, accidents happen. With Grant — bless his little rescued heart — some of those “accidents” seem suspiciously deliberate. Over time, we’ve learned that his occasional “act-out” mechanism of choice is peeing in stubborn defiance (<em>POW &#8230; take that, humans who would rather watch the Oscars than play fetch with me</em>).</p>\n<p>Rather than spend a fortune on enzyme products for animal stains, I’ve found that diluting a gentle laundry detergent in water works just as well. You get the same enzyme action, for just pennies per piddle.</p>\n<p>Another good way to eliminate any lingering eau de toilette aroma on carpet is by mixing 4 ounces of peroxide, about a teaspoon of dish soap, and a tablespoon of baking soda. Spritz this on the stain until saturated. Then place a clean towel over the top, and a heavy barbell or disc-weight over the top of that. Over a few hours, the fibers in the towel wick up the offending imperfection and any discoloration.</p>\n<h3>4. Challenge: Anxiety</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Thundershirt Official Site\" href=\"http://www.thundershirt.com/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Search%20|%20BR%20|%20ThunderShirt%20HV%20|%20Exact%20|%20USA&amp;utm_term=thundershirt&amp;utm_content=ThunderShirt%20HV%20|%20Exact\" target=\"_blank\">Thundershirts</a> have become <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/ten-calming-aids-for-fearful-anxious-or-nervous-dogs\" target=\"_blank\">a popular anxiety remedy for pups</a>, and for good reason: They’re handy, quick to apply, and relatively inexpensive. But remember, they exist because some merchandising wizard was smart enough to capitalize on the age-old practice of dog swaddling. This gentle wrapping technique is similar to swaddling an infant and leverages a natural soothing technique called &#8220;maintained pressure.&#8221; Animal science professor and autism activist Dr. Temple Grandin discovered that this pressure can break the cycle of agitated breathing (or panting, in the case of your dog), thereby leading to a natural, drug-free quieting response.</p>\n<p>Patient pet parents can use an Ace bandage to create a calming wrap. Select a wider bandage for large dogs, and a skinnier bandage for small dogs. Simply place the middle of this elasticized bandage across your dog’s chest. Bring both ends up, cross them over the upper back, and bring them over the top of the shoulder blades. Next, cross the loose ends of the bandage under the abdomen. Finally, bring the loose ends back up over the top of the lower back, and tie/tape them in place. You&#8217;re going for a helix or figure-eight type of pattern. The wrap should remain snug, but never tight — so carefully check it every so often. Granted, it’s not as stylish as a retail garment … but it can definitely get the job done, and for pennies.</p>\n<h3>5. Challenge: Cord chewing</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_341376\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341376 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18112626/RollWithIt-600x361.jpg\" alt=\"RollWithIt\" width=\"600\" height=\"361\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Just roll with it: Any type of hollow cardboard tube can serve as the basis for an effective, inexpensive cord-chewing deterrent. (Photo by Marybeth Bittel)</p></div>\n<p>When your family finishes a roll of toilet paper, paper towels, or gift wrap, <em>save</em> those cardboard tubes! Why? Because duct tape is now available to match your cords, couch, mood, manicure, or general décor. Pick your favorite color, then carefully tape the empty tubes around the exposed cord area. Here’s another option: Cut the toes off colored cotton socks, gently mist them with vinegar or bitter apple spray, and scrunch them end-to-end over the cord segment in question. If you pick a complementary color, this actually looks more decoratively European than you might think.</p>\n<h3>6. Challenge: Fur and fluff</h3>\n<p>I once fostered a sweet and beautiful <a title=\"Chow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Chow_Chow\" target=\"_blank\">Chow</a> mix with such pronounced shedding that she’d leave nearly life-sized replicas of herself all over the house. If you can relate, take heart — because regular rubber dish gloves can remove fur residue from most surfaces faster than you can say “wow.” In a pinch, I once used a rubberized shower squeegee with similar success. And don’t forget, draping a simple blanket, beach towel, fabric remnant, or pillowcase across pet beds and other favorite nap areas can be a time saver. Just throw these articles in the laundry when washing your own towels and bedding.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343620\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343620 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/03095206/shutterstock_365520482-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"(Rubber gloves by Shutterstock)\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The rubberized surface of your regular household dish gloves can help consolidate and sweep away most pet fur residue.

His tough talking-demeanor immediately goes away just as soon as he opens up about his two dogs. Dogster recently caught up with Jon and he told us all about Winston and Moxie and how dogs have played such an important role in his life.</p>\n<p><strong>Dogster: Jon, I am a little nervous that you are going to shut this interview down.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jon Taffer:</strong> [Laughter] To be honest with you, I would never shut anything down that has to do with dogs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341878\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341878 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21185859/600x449-600x449.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Taffer is the host of Spike's Bar Rescue and is an avid dog lover.

(Photos courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>You have a pretty big personality. Dogster readers might be surprised to learn that your dogs, Winston and Moxie, are on the smaller size. Tell us about them.</strong></p>\n<p>Winston is 10 years old, and he&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Miniature_Schnauzer\">Miniature Schnauzer</a>. He came from a breeder, and his parents were award-winning dogs. He is my incredible best friend, as he should be. People say that he is a little like me in that he is an extremely belligerent dog with an exceptional personality. For example, if I ask him to come here and he is in a bad mood, he will turn his back toward me and sit down. Then, he will turn his head, look at me, sort of smile, and come over anyway.</p>\n<p>We had a terrible health scare with him about a year ago, with cancer. We thought we were going to lose him. We sent him to an oncologist. He had three surgeries. But now, he is cancer free and he is just doing great.</p>\n<p>Moxie is a rescue dog, and she is a classic case of rescue. We rescued her about a year and a half ago. She is a sort of a <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Border_Collie\">Border Collie</a> mix and is a wonderful dog.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341879\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341879 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21190033/600x595-600x595.jpg\" alt=\"Mollie &amp; Winston at home. Photos provided by: Jon Taffer\" width=\"600\" height=\"595\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moxie and Winston at home. (Photo courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Tell us how you came to rescue Moxie.</strong></p>\n<p>Because of Winston, we would go to pet stores every Saturday and let him pick out treats and stuff.</p>\n<p>When we went, Moxie’s rescue, <a title=\"Friends for Life Humane Society,\" href=\"http://www.friendsforlifehumanesociety.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Friends for Life Humane Society,</a> was set up. Moxie was there for a week. She was emaciated, half of her hair was missing, and she was a very unattractive dog. The next Saturday, Moxie was still there and she was not looking good.</p>\n<p>Clearly, this is a dog who no one was going to take. When we went home that night and talked about it, it broke our hearts, but we didn’t think we were in a position to do it (adopt her).</p>\n<p>Then, the third week, we go back and Moxie is still there, skinnier and shaking. We had to take her because we knew that nobody else was going to.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341880\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341880 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21190231/600x600-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Moxie finds the perfect place to rest her head. Photo provided by Jon Taffer\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moxie finds the perfect place to rest her head. (Photo courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>How did Winston handle the new addition?</strong></p>\n<p>Winston was a little resistant. Moxie was 6 months old and was found on a street. She didn&#8217;t really have good social skills. She would sort of snap at Winston, and he&#8217;s never experienced anything like that before.</p>\n<p>It was interesting to watch over the six months how he evolved to be sort of her big brother, and now she mimics him and follows him and adores him.</p>\n<p>Moxie had some adjustment issues and social issues, as a rescue dog does sometimes. But people need to recognize that when you get past those issues, that&#8217;s what makes a rescue dog more rewarding than anything you can ever do. Moxie had never been in a family environment before. There were housebreaking issues, and we got past it. When you rescue a dog, in some cases you do it because of your heart, not because of logic. She has turned into one of the prides of my life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341885\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341885\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21191146/467x580.jpg\" alt=\"Winston is doing well despite a health scare last year.

(Photo courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Are you involved in rescue work</strong>?</p>\n<p>I used to be close to (actor-comedian) Buddy Hackett. He used to have a charity called Signita, and it was a no-kill animal shelter. I sat on the board of Signita for Buddy for a number of years. Buddy has since passed, and they couldn&#8217;t raise money, and, unfortunately, Signita is no longer operating. But being on the board of a no-kill animal facility and being able to see rescue not in terms of one or five dogs, but hundreds, is very moving. It has impacted me for the rest of my life. Anybody who rescues a dog, to me, is a hero.</p>\n<p>I am on the road 40 weeks a year shooting <em>Bar Rescue,</em> and I am a big believer in supporting locally. I feel that if we all focus locally and take care of the animals locally, we can solve this (pet overpopulation problem). I don&#8217;t like costs going to administration, I like everything getting right to the facility and the animals.</p>\n<p>My wife, Nicole, and I will do things all the time, like buy bags of food and toys and drop them off at shelters. We try to do what we can.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341882\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341882 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21190539/600x312-600x312.jpg\" alt=\"Jon relaxes at home with Winston and Moxie.

(Photo courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Did you have dogs growing up</strong>?</p>\n<p>I grew up with dogs, and I’ve had dogs my whole life. I am guessing that every child who ever had a dog will say this: “When I was growing up, my dog was the most intelligent dog who has ever lived on this planet.”</p>\n<p>My dog’s name was Sampson, and he was a Miniature Doberman, a <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Miniature_Pinscher\">Mini Pinscher</a>, and he was an amazing dog.</p>\n<p>When I was younger, I had a <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\">German Shepherd</a> named Caesar, and he got hit by a car and had to get his jaw wired closed so he could heal. So for six weeks, I had that dog tied to my leg, and I had to feed him soft food. That happened to me when I was about 18 or 19. It wiped me out financially and cost me thousands and thousands of dollars. That was one of the most important things that defined me in my life, when I had to sacrifice to come through for Caesar.</p>\n<p>Dogs have had profound effect on who I am and what I believe in. Dogs have added much compassion to my life and accountability. I couldn&#8217;t imagine not having one; it would be a real hole in our hearts.</p>\n<p><strong>Do Winston and Moxie come to work with you?</strong></p>\n<p>I have a tour bus that I bought a few years ago because of my dogs. There is nothing greater than traveling with your dogs. By having a tour bus, I can go anywhere with them. Winston and I are the boys of the family, and Moxie and my wife, Nicole, are the girls of family.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Winston and I go off on the bus on our own and we do guy stuff and the girls stay at home. Sometimes, I will take them both. There are a lot of ways we have fun with the dogs.</p>\n<p>The daddy-doggy trips in the bus are something that I look forward to every year. Maybe twice a year, I go away for three or four days with just Winston alone. We call it the &#8220;daddy-doggy&#8221; trip, and it&#8217;s just for the guys. He might get that extra bone that my wife doesn&#8217;t want him to get. (When this runs, I am going to be in big trouble. And that&#8217;s okay!)</p>\n<p>Winston and I have this guy-guy bond. The private time I get with him means very much to me.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341881\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341881\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21190412/590x585.jpg\" alt=\"When Jon is home, Winston is never far away. Photo provided by Jon Taffer\" width=\"600\" height=\"595\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">When Jon is home, Winston is never far away. (Photo courtesy Jon Taffer)</p></div>\n<p><strong>When you do a bar rescue, do people ask for Winston and Moxie?</strong></p>\n<p>When I have them on the road, everybody sees them and pets them, and they come out and say hello. I learned over the years that I don&#8217;t like to put dogs in kennels. We found that is extremely disruptive. We will take them on the bus because that is a second home. Really, the best thing you can do is not disrupt their lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share with us your thoughts on dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t own dogs. You live with them. Dogs are part of a family and a real commitment. They are in my soul and are a part of our lives, intertwined with us. I couldn&#8217;t imagine my life without dogs.</p>\n<p>Dogs and cats also have souls. When a dog is abused, we need to remember that it is a soul and it has eyes, ears, and a nose. It smells. It feels. It senses. It knows when it&#8217;s disliked, and it knows when it&#8217;s disrespected. They want peace and love, no different than us. They don&#8217;t want to be terrorized.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341883\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341883\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/21190652/547x744.jpg\" alt=\"Winston can't wait to see Jon when he comes home from being on the road.

And it&#8217;s the bond that writer-director Kyle Logan hopes to capture in a new animated short film currently making a call for funding on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1069831194/chase-the-ball\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a>.</p>\n<p>To give backers a sense of what the film will look like, Logan has posted a preview of <em><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1069831194/chase-the-ball\" target=\"_blank\">Chase The Ball</a>,</em> which is about a pup and his favorite toy. Set to The Yeah Yeah Yeahs &#8220;Little Shadow,&#8221; the two-minute video gives us a glimpse into the lifelong friendship between Chase the dog and his trusty tennis ball.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343550\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02180955/Chase-the-Ball-Kickstarter-600x647.jpg\" alt=\"Chase-the-Ball-Kickstarter\" width=\"600\" height=\"647\" /></p>\n<p>First we see an elderly Chase resting and gazing at the careworn tennis ball. Soon they&#8217;re cuddling together, and Chase&#8217;s owner comes by to give a pat on the head. Then, the dog, limp in his owner&#8217;s arms, is being carried out to the car. We&#8217;re seeing things from the ball&#8217;s perspective now, and it immediately becomes clear what&#8217;s going on. His friend is about to leave him forever.</p>\n<p>In a flashback, we see Chase the puppy when he&#8217;s small and spunky and first being introduced to his new tennis ball pal. Throughout the years, they play fetch in the mud, hang out with other dog-ball pairs at the park, open Christmas gifts together, seek refuge under a blanket during thunderstorms, and eventually grow old.</p>\n<p>In the end, the ball gets to be right by his friend as he&#8217;s laid to rest. It&#8217;s enough to make you burst into tears and tightly hug the pup curled up next to you on the couch. And that&#8217;s only the beginning. The full film still needs to reach its $48,000 Kickstarter funding goal to be produced. Imagine how moving it will be once finished.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1069831194/chase-the-ball/widget/video.html\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"> </iframe></p>\n<p>With just two weeks left, the campaign needs a good chunk of donations to realize Logan&#8217;s ultimate goal of completing the film and submitting it to festivals like Sundance. In addition to finishing the film, Logan also hopes to launch a new nonprofit, Chase the Ball Foundation, which will give animal shelters across the country new dog toys, just like the tennis ball in the film.</p>\n<p>Watch more videos we love:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/mutts-comic-strips-focus-on-shelter-animals-this-week\"><b>“MUTTS” Comic Strips Focus on Shelter Animals This Week</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-the-hilarious-kid-president-and-his-first-dog-annie-the-chihuahua\"><b>Meet the Hilarious Kid President and His First Dog, Annie the Chihuahua</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-asmr-is-and-how-i-use-it-to-ease-my-dogs-anxiety\"><b>What ASMR Is and How I Use It to Ease My Dog’s Anxiety</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong> Whitney C.

              "<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Editor’s note:</i></b><i> Have you seen the new Dogster print magazine in stores? Or in the waiting room of your vet’s office? This article appeared in our February/March issue. </i><a href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/B6/DFY/DogsterHomeCtrl033015b.jsp?cds_page_id=183914&amp;cds_mag_code=DFY&amp;id=1437762384091&amp;lsid=52051326240037584&amp;vid=1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Subscribe to Dogster</i></span></a><i> and get the bimonthly magazine delivered to your home.</i></p>\n<p>Inspiration is all around us these days. It’s in the glow of our phones and computer screens (someone might post the cutest puppy photo ever; it would be a shame to miss it) and in the binge watching of a new season of the best series on Netflix. And those candies aren’t going to crush themselves, are they? But with all of these distractions — ahem, inspirations — it’s easy to forget to be inspired by the furry ball of love at your feet. Here are seven things to inspire you to get up and play with your dog.</p>\n<h3>1. Keeping in shape</h3>\n<p>Facebook isn’t going to tone your thighs or reduce your pup’s potbelly. One great reason to forge outside with your dog and throw the old tennis ball is the cardiovascular benefit for the both of you. Burn a few calories while you have some fun. Can’t find your dog’s tennis ball? It’s under the couch making friends with the dust bunnies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341675\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341675\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20101410/dog-frisbee-snow-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Dog and Frisbee by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-133040147.html&amp;src=download_history\">Dog and Frisbee</a> by Shutterstock</p></div>\n<p>Adding one more walk to your routine or lengthening your current walks by just 15 minutes each can add up to more than a 200-calorie burn for you. For your dog, this can mean a few more treats that won’t pack the pounds onto his waist.</p>\n<h3>2. Upping your social media game</h3>\n<p>How many photos on your Instagram feed are of you snuggling on the couch with your dog? Could your profile pic use a new background? Every moment you stay glued to your computer, you’re losing out on valuable photo ops. How many likes can you get on a photo of you playing with your dog in front of a national landmark? Probably more than the 10th photo of Fifi in the bathtub (<a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/funny-wet-dog-pictures-photos-sophie-gamand-pet-photography-interview\" target=\"_blank\">although wet dogs are incredibly cute</a>).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341676\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341676\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20101414/woman-dog-selfie-2-600x446.jpg\" alt=\"Woman snaps dog's photo by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"446\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-311447909.html&amp;src=download_history\">Woman snaps dog&#8217;s photo</a> by Shutterstock</p></div>\n<p>Use social media to incentivize yourself to create fun photos with your dog. Is there a famous photo that you like or a friend’s photo you’ve always admired? Recreate it. Bonus points if you have to walk or drive to a park or other dog-friendly place. Double bonus points if you’ve found your dog’s tennis ball by now.</p>\n<h3>3. Meeting new people — and dogs!</h3>\n<p>Have you noticed how many people you meet at the dog park or at a dog-friendly location versus how many you meet at home playing <em>Rock Band</em> by yourself? The pizza delivery guy doesn’t count, even if he likes your dog.</p>\n<p>In case you don’t know this already, dog people are the best. When else can you approach a stranger and tell her that you wuvher puppy-wuppy-wuvvy-dovey- doggie-woggie-cutey-patootey’sadorable wittle facey-wacey? There’s rarely another occasion for that. Who else can you talk to about your dog’s <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/coprophagia-dog-health-food-why-do-dogs-eat-poop-ask-a-vet\" target=\"_blank\">adorable poop-eating habit</a> and have everyone in the room commiserate with you rather than vomit on your shoes? You can never have too many dog people in your life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341678\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341678\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20101418/woman-dog-snow-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Woman and dog in snow by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-160582250.html&amp;src=download_history\">Woman and dog in snow</a> by Shutterstock</p></div>\n<h3>4. Socializing your dog</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/i-let-my-dog-learn-the-ways-of-the-doggie-world-at-the-dog-park\" target=\"_blank\">Most dogs will benefit from being around other dogs</a>. Dog parks aren’t just for well-adjusted mutts who love everyone and everything. Only dogs need “dog time.” A shy dog may find a gentle playmate who gives him incentive to come out of his shell. Dogs who are too sheltered can develop fears and phobias. Exposing your dog regularly to new places, people, noises, scents, and objects can help him better navigate the world. If the weather is bad, invite a few dogs over for an indoor puppy play date.</p>\n<h3>5. Seeing new places</h3>\n<p>Don’t wait for someone to commit to going somewhere or taking a trip with you. Just look down. See that furry face? That’s the most committed soul in your life. Take your dog places you’ve never been before. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/get-out-and-go-tips-for-traveling-with-dogs-of-all-ages\" target=\"_blank\">Traveling with a pint-sized pooch has never been easier. </a>Have a bigger dog? Then it’s road trip time! Even if the road trip is just to a park in another neighborhood or a new hiking trail, you can explore all of it together. Bonus: new Facebook timeline photos and something to tweet about!</p>\n<h3>6. Keeping your dog’s brain occupied</h3>\n<p>Some dogs are content to couch potato their lives away, while others will chew the kitchen cabinets in a single moment of downtime. A dog with an active brain and high energy level needs the mental stimulation of play. If your dog is destructive, it’s likely because he needs something to do. Hiding treats around your house, playing fetch, or filling up a baby pool with snow and tossing in some yummy noms are all great ways to keep a busy dog’s brain focused on something productive.</p>\n<h3>7. Training ops</h3>\n<p>Playtime is the perfect time for training opportunities. For example, teaching your dog to fetch a Frisbee or tennis ball (have you found it yet?) is more than just play. During a game of fetch you are also instilling two important commands — the recall command (&#8220;come!&#8221;) and &#8220;drop it&#8221; — both of which are critical in keeping your dog safe. You can also teach the sit and wait commands during a game of fetch. Find games that will give your dog one or more new skills or reinforce the skills he already has.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more by Nikki Moustaki:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/7-tips-for-having-safe-outdoor-fun-with-your-dog-at-night\"><b>7 Tips for Having Safe Outdoor Fun With Your Dog at Night</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/do-you-use-hand-signals-for-basic-doggy-commands\"><b>Do You Use Hand Signals for Basic Doggy Commands?</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/use-toys-and-games-to-make-mealtime-fun-for-your-dog\"><b>Use Toys and Games to Make Mealtime Fun for Your Dog</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Nikki Moustaki is a dog trainer, dog rescuer, and pet expert.

Right now in the United States, the leading seeing eye dog programs are unable to place those specially trained dual-working dogs, who can both guide and provide mobility assistance with handlers.</p>\n<p>A Facebook friend of mine, Jae Spalding of Boston, Massachusetts, knows this situation all too well. They can’t be placed with another dual-trained dog because those programs simply aren&#8217;t doing the necessary training at this time. As I watched Spalding post about their experience of retiring their past service dog Drummer and being rejected from programs based on the nature of their disability, I wanted to share this story with Dogster readers; I was thrilled that Spalding was open to being interviewed.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342193\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342193 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24155002/dogster1-600x575.jpeg\" alt=\"dogster\" width=\"600\" height=\"575\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jae Spalding on their wedding day with  Drummer. (Photo courtesy Jae Spalding)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Dogster: I know you recently had to retire your previous service dog due to age. Can you talk a little bit about how working with him influenced your life?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Jae Spalding:</strong> Once my left hand wrapped around the leather handle of Drummer’s harness, I felt a sense of freedom I had never known. Step by step, year by year, we grew into one another. We learned the movement of our muscles in the heat, what it meant to feel exhaustion and freeze in the cold. He saved me from a rogue vehicle at a traffic light. I tripped when he ignored a curb because of a cute dog across the street. He corrected my mistakes, and I corrected his.</p>\n<p>We traveled the country together. He gave me confidence to explore places alone &#8212; no longer fearing I would walk into a pothole or trip over an unknown sign, tap-tap-tapping with my white cane to figure it out. And finally, he walked with me and my wife back up the aisle, after guiding wedding rings down the aisle and into my hands. My life was that of a concerned parent, loving friend, playmate, food giver, and rule maker. He was my confidant, wingman, doggie-child, annoying beastie, best dog friend.</p>\n<p><strong>For readers who don’t know much about it, what is it like working with a dual-trained guide dog?</strong></p>\n<p>I got my guide dog when I was able to walk distances over a mile unaided. About three-fourths of the way into our relationship, I began using a white balance cane in my other hand for stability and, well, balance! Eight months before <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/guide-service-dogs-what-happens-retire\" target=\"_blank\">Drummer and I made the choice to retire</a>, I was told by physical, occupational, and physiatrist therapists that I would need to begin using a wheelchair for distance travel if I wanted to maintain the level of mobility independence I was accustomed to. I got my first power chair (because trying to maneuver most anything else while using a dog or cane was impossible for me) in March 2015. By June 2015, Drummer had had enough. He was more than 9 years old.</p>\n<p>I spent some time training him between March and May 2015, and he did pick up guiding while I used the power chair quite well! He adjusted the clearance I would need on a sidewalk or road and found the curb cuts in sidewalks and such for me to maneuver onto.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342848\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342848\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28085049/shutterstock_316522328-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Guide dogs in training by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-316522328/stock-photo-blind-people-and-guide-dogs-during-the-last-training-for-the-animals-the-dogs-are-undergoing.html?src=JoE4Uwwrt232bplLVj-yvQ-1-46\">Guide dogs in training</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p><strong>What has it been like trying to get matched with a new dog</strong>?</p>\n<p>The school I received my amazing (and first) guide from, <a href=\"http://welcome.guidedogs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide Dogs for the Blind</a> in San Rafael, California, worked with me as I made the difficult choice to move forward with retirement and rehoming my pup. They were kind, considerate, and patient with my tears. The woman who came to pick him up and fly him back West waited patiently as I showed her his entire life (streamed via photo and video on my TV) and sat on the floor crying with him in my lap as I told him to be good and always goofy in his old-man age.</p>\n<p>I was informed immediately that my school was not continuing to dual-train guide dogs for students, alumni or not. So even though I was in good standing with the school, I could not come back and participate in the training they had pioneered nationwide. So I turned to <a href=\"http://www.guidedog.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Guide Dog Foundation</a> (Smithtown, New Jersey). It was the only school (after many sad phone calls and various explanations given) that had a current dual-train program and were accepting applicants. I held my breath and began the process!</p>\n<p>Since then, I received word that Guide Dog Foundation had suspended their training program indefinitely, and I was encouraged to seek a dual-trained guide elsewhere. They suggested Guide Dogs for the Blind. Remember them? So I looked online for dual-train programs, and Guide Dogs for the Blind pops up with a whole application page for alumni seeking dual-trained dogs. I cried the whole time I filled it out. I called my former field representative and left an excited voicemail. I called my wife and even sent out a silent message to my retired guide. I told him I would be OK. He was and is doing great, living with a nice retired man in sunny California.</p>\n<p>I got a call from my field rep and from admissions. They wanted to know where I found the information about dual-trained dogs and were shocked that I was able to apply for one. They explained that it was misinformation, and that they would not be able to help me. They were only accepting applications from alumni of the dual-train program.</p>\n<p>[Because Jae&#8217;s needs changed while Drummer was working but they hadn&#8217;t initially gone through the wheelchair guide program, Jae wasn&#8217;t eligible to be placed with a new dog.]</p>\n<p>It was suggested that I should perhaps try self-training a dog to guide me both while I use my wheelchair and when I walk. The task still feels impossible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342856\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342856\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28085753/shutterstock_293243222-600x393.jpg\" alt=\"Guide dog in training by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-293243222/stock-photo-labrador-retriever-guide-dog-before-the-last-training-for-the-animal-the-dogs-are-undergoing.html?src=Vo-wdhj02kVvxIJDiXv5og-1-8\">Guide dog in training</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The more that I heard about Jae&#8217;s story, the more I was curious about what would make guide dog programs stop or decrease access to this kind of immensely important work. It seemed so counterintuitive that these programs would leave guide dog handlers isolated.</p>\n<p>I spoke with representatives from Guide Dogs for the Blind (GDB) and Guide Dog Foundation (GDF), the two leading training schools for placing seeing eye dogs in the United States.</p>\n<p>Karen Woon, vice president of marketing from GDB, provided me with the following statement about its training program and its inability to take new applicants to the dual training program:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Guide Dogs for the Blind remains committed to providing replacement dogs to current GDB wheelchair program graduates if the individuals meet our qualifications. Due to the highly specialized skills and length of time involved in training wheelchair guide dogs, we are not currently accepting any new applicants for these services. &#8221;</p>\n<p>I had a more hopeful and in-depth conversation with Guide Dog Foundation. GDF isn’t currently able to place these specially dual-trained dogs, but it intends to in the future.</p>\n<p>Andrew Rubenstein, director of marketing for GDF, explained, “At this time we are not fully staffed in that area [wheelchair guides] and are restructuring the program to better meet the needs of our constituents. Once we feel we are able to meet those needs &#8212; we anticipate by the second quarter of 2016 &#8212; we will welcome new applicants to the program.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this leaves people like Jae without a clear idea of when they could get partnered with a new guide and regain access to the world that is closed off without a dog.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/houstons-friends-for-life-helps-a-stray-dog-named-mother-mary-give-birth-on-christmas-day\"><b>Houston’s Friends for Life Helps a Stray Dog Named Mother Mary Give Birth on Christmas Day</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-two-amazing-weekend-puppy-raisers-for-a-prison-training-program\"><b>Meet Two Amazing Weekend Puppy Raisers for a Prison Training Program</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\"><b>Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Sassafras Lowrey is a dog-obsessed author based in Brooklyn.

              "<p>One of my favorite things about dogs is that they cannot tell a lie. Not because they can’t talk, but simply because they just don’t lie. It’s not in their wheelhouse, thankfully.</p>\n<p>This inability to lie has huge implications on how we train these wonderful creatures. Here are three real-life examples that could have turned out horribly for the dog had I as the trainer and the owners not really heard what the dog was telling us.</p>\n<h3>1. Puppy pees a lot</h3>\n<p>This summer I worked with a young <a title=\"Golden Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Golden_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Retriever</a> who was enrolled by her owner in my Puppy Enrichment Program. We know from scientific research that the crucial time to properly and positively socialize a dog is before he reaches 16 weeks of age.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343069\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343069 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31161538/goldenpuppyonmat-e1454358789379-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"goldenpuppyonmat\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Little puppy Bella had a peeing problem caused by a urinary tract infection &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t being stubborn! (Photo by Tica Clarke Photography)</p></div>\n<p>Puppies stay with me during this impressionable time for a minimum of two weeks, and during that time I help them learn to positively navigate the human world in which they have found themselves. Bella was frantic puppy from the get-go. She had trouble concentrating and her energy was all over the place. My biggest concern for her, however, was the enormous amount of time she spent urinating. When she had to go, she had to go, and that was A LOT. When she wasn’t sleeping, she asked to go outside at least three times an hour, often five or more times. A few times she didn’t make it to door and peed as she ran toward it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343070\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343070 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31161636/goldenpuppytunnel-600x483.jpg\" alt=\"goldenpuppytunnel\" width=\"600\" height=\"483\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Training Bella was so much easier after the veterinarian cleared up her urinary tract infection. (Photo by Tica Clarke Photography)</p></div>\n<p>She peed on my rugs more than once. What if I had wrongly interpreted her behavior as being defiant? What if I labeled her “stubborn” or “stupid&#8221;? And worse than any of the labels, imagine if I had physically punished her for all of that peeing? Instead, I recognized that this was abnormal behavior. I called the owner, and she immediately came out and took Bella to the vet. My suspicions were confirmed: Bella had a urinary tract infection.</p>\n<p>She left my program and went home for 10 days on an antibiotic. She came back after that, and the peeing issue was resolved. She wasn’t lying about needing to pee that urgently. She wasn’t being naughty, stubborn, or trying on purpose to disobey. She had a painful medical condition. How unfair it would have been for me to punish her for a physical problem.</p>\n<h3>2. Dog loves spinach</h3>\n<p>Really? Well, that’s what a client told me. It was more than just spinach. She said her dog, Simba, would eat anything and everything, and she ate it so quickly that the owner was concerned about the gulping behavior. Her dog was so over-fixated on food that training her had become quite a challenge due to her strong reaction to the presence of any food. I asked her to bring the dog over for a taste test. I wanted confirmation for myself that there was a spinach-loving dog out there.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343072\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343072 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31161753/1907792_10153024390012917_4672096589571029743_n-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"1907792_10153024390012917_4672096589571029743_n\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We did a taste test with Simba to see which foods she really, really liked. (Photo by Tica Clarke Photography)</p></div>\n<p>The <a title=\"Labrador\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador</a> came into my training room acting like she was starving, which she clearly was not. I asked her owner to hold on to her leash as I laid out several rows of training treats, starting with the spinach, then carrots, apples, turkey, hamburger, and cheese on the last row. I asked Simba’s owner to release her dog, and Simba ran over to the food as though she had not eaten in a month. Sure enough, she scooped up every piece of food, starting with the spinach. Huh. Maybe there is a spinach-loving dog out there.</p>\n<p>Simba ate with such speed that I rather doubted she stopped to even sniff or taste any of the treats. We replicated the lines of treats three more times and moved around the lines so the food would not be lined up in the same order. Every time Simba scooped up every morsel &#8230; except for the last time. The last time, in fact, she ate everything BUT the spinach. Hmm.</p>\n<p>So I tested her two more times with the same ingredients, and each time she left only the spinach.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343073\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343073 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31161852/11259199_10153024390317917_2495341967619380362_n-600x523.jpg\" alt=\"11259199_10153024390317917_2495341967619380362_n\" width=\"600\" height=\"523\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We needed to know what foods Simba loved and didn&#8217;t love so much to aid in her training. (Photo by Tica Clarke Photography)</p></div>\n<p>What is the moral to this spinach story? Simba didn’t care for spinach that much after all. In the beginning of our taste tests, she was willing to inhale everything in front of her, but as she began to feel satiated, she got a bit pickier. This lead us to change her training treats. I asked Simba’s owner to use a specially designed bowl that slows down eating (<a href=\"http://pets.petsmart.com/brands/martha-stewart/how-to-articles/\">such as these</a>) for meals. For training, we would continue to find things like spinach that didn’t push Simba’s taste buds over the edge.</p>\n<p>Because we knew from a taste test that spinach was a low priority, her owner would begin working on calming exercises first using spinach and after a meal. As Simba gradually learned how to relax around food, better treats could be slowly brought into the mix. We needed to slow Simba down because there is a risk of bloating or choking from eating that quickly, not to mention the need to calm Simba down <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-use-food-to-motivate-your-dog-during-training\" target=\"_blank\">in the presence of food so that quality training sessions could begin.</a></p>\n<p>Simba couldn’t fake a love of spinach, but we needed to really investigate that to determine if she would readily eat everything in front of her, as had been assumed.</p>\n<h3>3. Adult dog begins marking in the house</h3>\n<p>I cut my training teeth working with shelter dogs years ago. I ended up training and fostering more than 400 shelter dogs over an extended period of time. When I first began bringing these dogs into our home, my highly trained <a title=\"Border Collie\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Border_Collie\" target=\"_blank\">Border Collie</a> named Radar was 4 years old. He had never so much as had one peeing accident in the house, even as a puppy, and yet he suddenly began peeing on my furniture. It happened to correspond with the presence of the foster dogs, so I wrongly accused Radar of marking to let the new dogs know that the territory had been claimed by him. I could not have been more wrong.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343074\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343074 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31161942/rayface-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"rayface\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My adult dog named Radar suddenly began peeing in the house, and it took a vet exam to figure out the real reason why. (Photo by Annie Phenix)</p></div>\n<p>We lived on a 100-acre ranch at the time, and my dogs had a doggie door and access to a fenced backyard, so I wasn’t observing how many times Radar went outside to urinate. For some reason, one morning I decided to put him on leash and walk in our neighborhood instead of our usual off-leash walks on our ranch. Thank goodness I did, because that’s when the lightbulb went off for me &#8212; Radar peed every few steps! We didn’t happen to have a foster dog in the house that week or on that walk. I made a veterinarian appointment that day. It turned out that Radar had a kidney infection. The only outward sign he displayed was an increase in urination and his new habit of peeing inside the house.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343075\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343075 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31162052/radarsnow-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"radarsnow\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My dog Radar stopped peeing in the house after a month of being on antibiotics. There was a physical reason for his unwanted behavior. (Photo by Annie Phenix)</p></div>\n<p>What if I yelled at him or even hit him for peeing on my furniture? I did interrupt him when I caught him doing it and put him outside for a little bit, but I never punished him or scared him. He went on antibiotics and stopped peeing in the house.</p>\n<p>It’s important when dealing with a sentient animal who does not have the gift of human language that instead of labeling him or assuming we know exactly what’s going on, we take a step back. Put on an investigator’s hat and REALLY look at all possibilities that may be creating unwanted behavior. I always encourage dog owners to first and foremost rule out a medical issue before starting behavior modification work.</p>\n<p>Dogs don’t lie. They aren’t stubborn, and it’s up to us as the smarter mammal to find workable solutions for behaviors that we don’t like.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Read more by Annie Phenix:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/the-pet-professional-guild-formally-denounces-shock-collars-and-it-is-right-to-do-it\">There Is No Reason to Use a Shock Collar.

I&#8217;m a tall, 41-year-old Caucasian woman. Before you get to know him, we seem like a bit of an odd couple. More than once I&#8217;ve been asked which dog at the dog park is mine, and when I point to my sweet boy, the response is, &#8220;Oh. That one?&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343077\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343077\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31163308/dog-owner-alike1-Copy-600x406.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins and Wendy (Photo by Lori Fusaro)\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins and Wendy (Photo by Lori Fusaro)</p></div>\n<p>We are two peas in a pod, though. In many ways, my sweet baby boy is the apple that didn&#8217;t fall far from the tree. Who knows if it is because I raised him to be my Mini Me or if we were just lucky to find each other. Like many dog-parent duos out there, we are the perfect fit. Here are a few ways we are more alike than you might notice at first:</p>\n<h3>1. Loyalty to our pack</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_343085\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343085\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31163316/dog-owner-alike_9-Copy-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins and a few of his pack mates including Luna, the dalmatian (All photos by Wendy Newell unless otherwise noted.) \" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins and a few of his packmates, including Luna the <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Dalmatian\" target=\"_blank\">Dalmatian</a>. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>Riggins and I both tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. That is, unless they smell weird or look really creepy. We will happily hang out with you and share some fun times. If you wrong us personally, we may give you the cold shoulder, but it may be a forgivable offense. If you hurt one of our friends, we will make you pay!</p>\n<p>As a dog sitter, Riggins has a pack that is ever-changing, but he looks out for everyone, especially those pups who are regulars. One day I had to leave the house for a bit. I separated the dogs into two areas of the room so they were sharing space with dogs of the same temperament and size. Luna, a deaf Dalmatian who is with us one night a week, was in the kitchen with a couple of pups, while <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-riggins-is-a-full-partner-in-my-dog-sitting-business\" target=\"_blank\">Riggins was in charge</a> of the living room area. They could see each other, but couldn&#8217;t move back and forth between the rooms.</p>\n<p>When I got home I noticed Luna had a cut on her head. It looked like a scratch from a tooth because of rough play. I didn&#8217;t have to wonder who the culprit was, because as soon as I opened the gate between the two rooms, Riggins went straight to an overanxious puppy and put him in his place!</p>\n<h3>2. PDA on our own terms</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_343081\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343081\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/31163312/dog-owner-alike_5-Copy-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Cuddle time.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cuddle time.

When he is over it, he is over it, and trying to initiate more lovin&#8217; just makes him look back at you in disgust, as if to say, &#8220;Control yourself!&#8221;</p>\n<p>His mom is the same way. I even have a similar look.</p>\n<h3>3.

(Photo by Lori Fusaro)</p></div>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to be near either of us when hunger turns us into angry beings with little to no tolerance for anyone or anything. Riggins will sit and bark at me for as long as it takes to get fed. His bark goes from a reminder, to urgent, to pleading, and finally to full-on pissed off!</p>\n<p>I bark, too. At people with demands. It&#8217;s not our fault. We don&#8217;t mean to be such horrible monsters. We are just hungry!</p>\n<h3>4.

Luckily, we are easily amused.</p>\n<p>For Riggins, nothing makes him happier than chasing tennis balls at the park. They don&#8217;t have to be thrown far; heck, they don&#8217;t even have to be entirely intact. They just need to be moving in a direction away from him so he can give chase. He isn&#8217;t going to bring them back, of course. That&#8217;s too much trouble, but for a good 15 minutes, you will have his undivided attention.</p>\n<p>Me? I&#8217;m the gal who wants to watch a half-hour sitcom with a solid beginning, middle, and end, with a few giggles thrown in now and then. Some people think sitcoms aren&#8217;t good TV, but I think it&#8217;s the best way to spend some down time!</p>\n<h3>5.

He is not happy with this arrangement and is always trying to sneak into the car on his off days.</p>\n<p>I live by the motto taught to me by my own mother, &#8220;Never say no to fun.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>6.

              "<p>It seems like Oregon is due a break from bad news. For the last month, news about Oregon was dominated by a bunch of gun-toting lunatics whose antics range from ridiculous to downright scary.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s more bad news, and it’s not as easy to mock as the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. <a href=\"http://www.seattledogspot.com/dog-news/oregon-pet-rental-company-euthanizes-3-adoptable-dogs/\">According to Seattle Dog Spot</a>, a Portland-based animal leasing company called <a title=\"Hannah the Pet Society\" href=\"http://www.hannahsociety.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hannah the Pet Society</a> recently euthanized three adoptable dogs for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>The three dogs &#8212; Charlie Bear, Kelso, and Pip &#8212; were put down by order of Hannah founder Dr. Scott Campbell on Nov. 24, 21015. They were scheduled to be returned to the shelters they had originally come from, but Campbell decided otherwise. In an internal email about one of the dogs, he told the staff bluntly: “Kill him.”</p>\n<p>The piece in Seattle Dog Spot is very detailed about the ages, breeds, and behavior histories of each of the three dogs. While Hannah claims that the dogs were euthanized because of “aggression,” there doesn’t seem to be any record of the kind of vicious behavior that would make that necessary. In fact, <i>Seattle Dog Spot</i> points out that in a monumental screwup, Hannah sent out emails the day after they killed the dogs offering Pip and Charlie Bear as potential adoptees. Pip was described as a “delightful charmer” suitable for children, and Charlie Bear was called a “noble confidant” who was “laid back” in temperament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343011\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343011\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29111029/pip-euthanized-by-hannah-dog-society-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Pip, a 2-year-old Australian Terrier mix was called a &quot;Delightful Charmer&quot; by the company's public promotions.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pip, a 2-year-old <a title=\"Australian Terrier\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Australian_Terrier\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Terrier</a> mix, was called a &#8220;delightful charmer&#8221; in the company&#8217;s public promotions.</p></div>\n<p>The idea of leasing a dog or other pet is weird enough for me. It’s one of those things that my brain knows to exist, but can’t quite accept. Every time a report of one of these services crops up, I have an instinctive recoil, trying to integrate the fact that, yes, these things still happen. My main strategy for remaining sane while combing through the media comes from a line in Elvis Costello’s “(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes”: “I used to be disgusted, but now I try to be amused.”</p>\n<p>But that only goes so far. Sometimes I can only be disgusted. Looking at Seattle Dog Spot’s account of the dogs’ death builds a strong case that Hannah euthanized Charlie Bear, Kelso, and Pip for the sake of convenience rather than any intractable behavior problems.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time that animal lovers and organizations have expressed concern about Hannah the Pet Society. Criticisms of the company go back at least to 2013, when <a href=\"http://www.kptv.com/story/22063982/concerns-raised-about-pet-leasing-company-hannah-pet-society\">Portland TV station KPTV reported</a> that the Oregon Humane Society had issued a statement expressing doubts about Hannah’s ethics and the sources of its animals. It read in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We support out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to saving lives, and this is certainly the case with a company that occasionally sources animals from shelters and leases them to caretakers &#8230; We are concerned about the source of animals when not coming from shelters. Hannah society has not shared with us any criteria that would preclude the lease of puppy mill source dogs &#8230; for the people who read the fine print and are looking for a less committed relationship, this might be the right choice. Whether it&#8217;s the right choice for pets remains to be seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the same report, one of Hannah’s customers, Diane Tate, said that the company’s contract was so ambiguous that she didn’t realize she wouldn’t actually own the dog. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t really clear initially that you were renting the dog,” she told KPTV. “(It wasn&#8217;t clear) that all the decisions would be made by Hannah the Pet Society. You would be consulted, but other than that, everything is their decision.” When she tried to back out of the contract, Tate said that the company began pressuring her so hard to stay in the agreement that it felt like harassment.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343010\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343010\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29111028/kelso-euthanized-by-hannah-dog-society-600x686.jpg\" alt=\"Kelso was an 11-month-old Lab mix, whose assessment said, &quot;Is ok with other dogs/Is friendly to new people/High energy/Very loving and playful&quot;\" width=\"600\" height=\"686\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kelso was an 11-month-old <a title=\"Lab\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Lab</a> mix whose assessment said, &#8220;Is ok with other dogs/Is friendly to new people/High energy/Very loving and playful.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pawsanimalshelter.org/\">PAWS shelter in West Linn, Oregon</a>, also said that when it offered a kitten to the company, it refused. A volunteer at PAWS told KPTV, &#8220;They advertise that they work with shelters and get their animals from shelters and rescues, when in fact they only take again the highly adoptable, easily sold, pretty animals.”</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1lWI032oe4?rel=0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/12/08/couple-take-pet-leasing-store-to-court.htm\">Hannah was also sued by two clients, Sandee and Walter Strunk</a>, in December 2014. The Strunks alleged that Hannah was using its leasing model to get around normal licensing requirements and used a number of pressure tactics to lock them into an agreement in which the company holds all the cards. According to the lawsuit, the company demanded a $600 fee for the couple to cancel the agreement. According to Courtroom News:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The cancellation fee is intended as a punitive forfeiture penalty to discourage consumers from ever terminating their monthly payment obligations to defendant,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Strunks claim Hannah&#8217;s leases pets because it knows people are unlikely to return an animal they have grown to love &#8220;if they cannot be sure that the pet will not be euthanized by defendant, which exercises sole discretion to make life-ending decisions as the owner of the pet.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter how you slice it, one thing seems clear: Something is rotten at Hannah the Pet Society. Until now, complaints around Hannah have mainly been focused on financial profiteering on people’s love for their pets; now there are at least three bodies to be accounted for.</p>\n<p>To be fair, the rot probably isn’t in Hannah specifically but in the entire model of leasing pets. Reporting on the Strunk lawsuit in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.seattledogspot.com/dog-adoption-rescue/oregon-couple-sues-pet-leasing-company/\">Seattle Pet Spot<i> </i>made some excellent points</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I should say here that I don’t like the idea of renting pets.<strong> It reinforces the concept that pets are expendable,</strong> which is how so many dogs end up in shelters.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You dog peed on your carpet or barks too much? Just return it to the shelter. Getting a new puppy? Make room for it by turning your older dog over to a shelter. Moving to a new city and can’t take your dog? Just leave it in your yard for someone else to deal with.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Another reason I don’t like the rent-a-pet model is that it is focused on making as much money as possible, and since Hannah is the legal owner of the pets it leases, it may make decisions about a pet’s health based on its bottom line instead of what’s in the best interest of the pet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, pet leasing comes with many of the same problems of buying from a pet store, plus a few more. Hannah claims that most of its dogs come from shelters and rescue organizations, but by last November, the only organization that was contracted to give them animals was the <a title=\"Columbia Humane Society\" href=\"http://columbiahumane.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Humane Society</a> in Saint Helens, Oregon. After the three dogs were euthanized, Columbia naturally severed the relationship.</p>\n<p>So now where is Hannah getting its dogs? That’s a murky and important question for any ethical pet owner.</p>\n<p>But at least when you take a dog home from the pet store, you know that even if he had a traumatic history at some hellish puppy farm, you can provide him with a healthy and happy future. When you lease a pet from Hannah or a similar service, they control all the decisions about the dog’s health. For life.</p>\n<p>Whatever the facts behind the death of these three dogs, one thing seems clear: Pet leasing is bad for both humans and animals, and Hannah seems to be especially bad.</p>\n<p>Tell us your take on renting pets in the comments.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more commentary from Chris Hall:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/petas-war-on-pit-bulls-is-not-ethical-or-good-for-animals\"><b>PETA’s War on Pit Bulls Is Not Ethical or Good for Animals</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/commentary-stop-debating-whether-homeless-people-should-have-pets\"><b>Commentary: Stop Debating Whether Homeless People Should Have Pets</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/would-you-clone-your-dog-for-100000-should-you-clone-your-dog\"><b>Would You Clone Your Dog for $100,000?

McDonnell went there because he wanted to feature shelter dogs and cats in his work, and he took a hands-on role with staff, volunteers, and the hundreds of animals in ACC’s care; the experience impacted him greatly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I realized that Mooch and Earl have such great homes and loving guardians, and I thought about all the dog and cats who don&#8217;t and are just sitting in shelters waiting,&#8221; he said in the <em>Shelter Me</em> episode, debuting in May.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342454\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342454 size-medium\" src=\"http://d39kbiy71leyho.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01143754/mutts-2-600x188.jpg\" alt=\"mutts-2\" width=\"600\" height=\"188\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reissued online by special permission of King Features Syndicate.</p></div>\n<p>McDonnell soaked in what he experienced and then turned it into art: a series of <em>MUTTS</em> strips, featuring the actual dogs, cats, and other animals he met. Every day this week, a new strip debuts in more than 700 newspapers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342451\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342451 size-medium\" src=\"http://d39kbiy71leyho.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01143752/cat-hgigh-five-600x335.jpg\" alt=\"The high-fiving cat in real life.\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Here’s the high-fiving cat in real life.</p></div>\n<p>“I wasn’t sure what to expect when I arrived at the ACC of NYC, but what I found was dedicated, driven staff and volunteers; actively involved rescue groups; a supportive community; and adoptable, loving animals,” said McDonnell. “ACC is rapidly becoming a role model for large-scale city shelters, and NYC should be proud of all that has been accomplished.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342453\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342453 size-medium\" src=\"http://d39kbiy71leyho.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01143753/mutts-1news-600x189.jpg\" alt=\"mutts-1news\" width=\"600\" height=\"189\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reissued online by special permission of King Features Syndicate.</p></div>\n<p>We&#8217;re not too familiar with the funny pages, but we&#8217;re pretty sure there have not been a lot of shelters featured throughout the years, despite the untold numbers of dogs and cats who make up the cast of characters. Kudos to McDonnell for shinning a light on those who need it so much.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was an uplifting experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My hope is that by telling these stories, readers will be inspired to support their local shelters and to adopt a new best buddy.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342450\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342450 size-medium\" src=\"http://d39kbiy71leyho.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01143751/mutts-d0g-600x334.jpg\" alt=\"mutts-d0g\" width=\"600\" height=\"334\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">McDonnell at work.</p></div>\n<p>Check out a preview of the <em>Shelter Me</em> episode <a href=\"http://shelterme.tv/\">&#8220;Hearts and Paws,”</a> which was created with help from the Petco Foundation and Halo, Purely for Pets:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/153728943\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To see more of this week&#8217;s strips, head to the <a href=\"http://www.mutts.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MUTTS</em> website</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more dog news:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/this-bonehead-stole-a-yorkshire-terrier-puppy-and-traded-her-for-crack\"><b>This Bonehead Stole a Yorkshire Terrier Puppy and Traded Her for Crack</b></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/this-bonehead-drove-a-car-through-an-animal-clinic\"><b>This Bonehead Drove a Car Through an Animal Clinic</b></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/bonehead-handler-dumps-his-retired-police-dog-in-a-kill-shelter\"><b>Bonehead Handler Dumps His Retired Police Dog in a Kill Shelter</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/mutts-comic-strips-focus-on-shelter-animals-this-week\">&#8220;MUTTS&#8221; Comic Strips Focus on Shelter Animals This Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com\">Dogster</a>.</p>\n"

Unlike my smaller dog, Marshmallow, he doesn’t need a parka &#8212; but I sure do.</p>\n<p>I’m in full winter gear when we head out into the freezing temps, and that includes a pair of thick mittens. I prefer mittens to gloves because my fingers get to hang out together and keep each other warm. Unfortunately, the thumb on my leash hand ends up too far from the group and gets painfully cold. That’s why I was excited to try the <a title=\"Winter Leash\" href=\"http://winterleash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Leash</a>, a new product that bills itself as the only leash that keeps your hand warm.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342424\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342424\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114322/HM-and-GB-winter-leash-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"Don't let the open coat fool you -- it's cold up here! (Photo courtesy Heather Marcoux)\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">GhostBuster and I trying out the Full Winter Leash. Don&#8217;t let the open coat fool you &#8212; it&#8217;s cold up here! (Photo courtesy Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>The folks at Winter Leash sent me two versions of the product to test out: the <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/full-winter-leash/product.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Winter Leash</a> and the <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/index.php?option=com_hikashop&amp;view=product&amp;layout=show&amp;Itemid=460\" target=\"_blank\">Swivel Shackle</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Full Winter Leash is essentially a leash with a built-in mitten, ideal for walking one dog and perfect for my nighttime strolls with GhostBuster. It’s not always just me and my boy, though. We also walk with Marshmallow during the warmer parts of the day, and that’s when the Swivel Shackle comes in handy. Unlike the Full Winter Leash, there is no lead attached to this mitten. Instead, the shackle allows the walker to attach multiple leashes or a coupler (great for walking GhostBuster and Marshy simultaneously). Both versions of the mitten are thumbless, so your whole hand stays together inside the mitt for maximum warmth. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342422\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342422\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114319/winter-leashes-600x349.jpg\" alt=\"The Swivel Shackle and the Full Winter leash -- similar but different. (Photo by Heather Marcoux)\" width=\"600\" height=\"349\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Swivel Shackle and the Full Winter leash &#8212; similar but different. (Photo by Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>Inside the mittens are <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two handles to control the leash or shackle. There’s a small loop and a big loop, so you have a few options for getting a good grip. I like to use both handles for maximum control (especially handy when my Marshmallow spots one of the many wild neighborhood rabbits or that sassy <a title=\"Beagle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagle</a> she hates so much). The Full Winter Leash also has an extra handle at the top of the leash so you can control your dog with two hands if need be (again, super handy in rabbit emergencies).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342423\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342423\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114320/Marshy-GB-Winter-leash-coupler-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"My inappropriately attired husband using the Swivel Shackle while out with GhostBuster and Marshmallow (Photo by Heather Marcoux)\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My inappropriately attired husband using the Swivel Shackle while out with GhostBuster and Marshmallow. (Photo by Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>Both Winter Leashes (as well as <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/carabiner/product.html\" target=\"_blank\">another option with a carabiner</a>) are made in the USA, and both have a cool utility pocket on the outside, which was perfect for carrying my keys and a few poop bags. The two mitts I tried were made of different materials. The Full Winter Leash mitten is comprised of a blue, limited-edition fabric known as</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polartec PowerShield, while the black </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swivel Shackle mitten uses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polartec’s Windbloc material. The blue leash is a little softer inside, but both kept my hand nice and toasty while braving the winter weather with GhostBuster.</span></p>\n<p>I really liked walking with the Winter Leash because my thumb was no longer lonely and able to keep warm with the rest of my fingers, but it did put me at a disadvantage when it came to picking up poop. When I wear my regular mitts, I don’t have to expose my hand at all if I’m using a large bag with handles, and only have to expose my hand briefly if using the small poop bags that come in a roll. Because the Winter Leash mitts are thumbless, I have to take my hand out in order to peel open a bag, pick up a poop, and tie the bag shut. I’m trying to train myself to use my non-leash hand for poop grabbing, but getting a bag open and tying it requires thumbs.</p>\n<h3>Dogster scorecard for the Winter Leash</h3>\n<p><b>Quality: </b>A+. The fabrics are great, as is the hardware. The trigger-style snap on the end of the Full Winter Leash isn’t something I’m used to, but works well. The webbing for the full leash is great quality and sourced from a manufacturer on Rhode Island.</p>\n<p><b>Style:</b> I’m way more concerned with function than style when it comes to walking during the winter. That being said, these aren’t ugly. Certainly no worse than most heavy-duty mitts.</p>\n<p><b>Function:</b> My hands stayed warm and I still had great control &#8212; even with two dogs.</p>\n<p><b>Creativity:</b> The guy behind Winter Leash, Mike, is a former Army Ranger who used his experience with military textiles in developing the product. The Winter Leash is unlike anything I’ve seen at my local pet stores.</p>\n<p><b>Value: </b>At $49.99 &#8211; $54.99, the Winter Leash isn’t inexpensive, but the high-quality materials of this American-made product mean you can expect to be using this thing for multiple seasons. The Full Winter Leash won’t set you back much more than a quality leash and a pair of thermal mittens would.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-health-tips-how-to-winterize-your-dog-winter-cold-weather\" target=\"_blank\">If you live in a cold climate</a> and suffer from frozen thumbs, the Winter Leash is a good buy. Before using this product, the thumb on my leash hand would always be freezing cold long before the rest of me. Cold hands can mean shorter walks, something that’s fine by Marshmallow but not cool with GhostBuster. Inside the Winter Leash, my thumb stays warm and my leash hand is actually warmer than my other hand now.</p>\n<p>Who’s got two warm thumbs now and can stay outside just as long as GhostBuster? This lady!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more Dogster Reviews:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-6-dogs-try-out-the-piddle-place-potty-system\"><b>My 6 Dogs Try Out the Piddle Place Potty System</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-attempts-at-keeping-my-dog-safe\"><b>It Has Taken Me Years to Find the Safest Collar, Harness, and Leash for My Dog</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/the-active-pack-tests-kurgos-car-safety-products-for-dogs-and-drivers\"><b>The Active Pack Tests Kurgo’s Car Safety Products for Dogs and Drivers</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><i>About the Author:</i></b><i> Heather Marcoux is a freelance writer in Alberta, Canada.

After her 11 puppies were born, she was dumped at <a title=\"Milton Animal League\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/miltonanimalleague/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Animal League</a> with the reason of suspected <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/mange-in-dogs-causes-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">mange</a>. With red skin and missing much of her fur, Blueberry was in a miserable state. With proper veterinary care, she was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-allergies-hives-itching-blood-skin-test-food-elimination-diet\" target=\"_blank\">allergies</a>, and treatment began to clear her skin. Maura Porter, a volunteer at the shelter, had recently lost her dog to leukemia and fell in love with Blueberry.</p>\n<p>Maura had also lost a friend, Gerry, to cancer. Her friend had never liked animals, but after a dog visited him during hospice care, he began to soften his stance. To honor Gerry&#8217;s memory, Maura wanted to do therapy dog work, as well as help change people&#8217;s minds about <a title=\"Pit Bull\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier\" target=\"_blank\">Pit Bull</a>-type dogs.</p>\n<p>However, Blueberry&#8217;s future as a therapy dog was uncertain because of her past confinement; her only interaction with other dogs was when she was being bred. They began training for the AKC Canine Good Citizen test anyway, and Maura found that her doubts were completely unfounded. Blueberry succeeded in every area. In fact, she was the first dog in her group to pass the challenging CGC test.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342054\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342054\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23122624/IMG_0015-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry at graduation from therapy dog school.

She brings more joy to people that I could ever have imagined.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blueberry has been doing therapy dog work for almost three years now, visiting nursing homes, rehab hospitals, and colleges during exam times. They also have assigned hospice patients for weekly visits and have visited with blind and deaf residents of the New England Homes for the Deaf. &#8220;What is amazing to see is that her breed does not matter to the people with whom she visits,&#8221; Maura says. &#8220;All they see is her love.

Blueberry went to the bombing site for three weeks. &#8220;People whispered in her ear, others told her how saddened they were,&#8221; Maura recalls. &#8220;It was amazing to see them open up to a dog. It was like it was OK to open up to her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once Boylston Street had been completely reopened to the public, Blueberry and Maura visited Copley Square, where a makeshift memorial had started to form. People were drawn to Blueberry, as well as the other therapy dog teams. &#8220;One woman, a trauma nurse, told me that she had not wanted to come back down, but that once she spent time with Blueberry she was so glad she had faced her fears,&#8221; Maura says. &#8220;At one point, as I sat on the ground with Blueberry, watching her interact with the person she was with, I looked up and saw people waiting &#8212; 15 people deep &#8212; just to be with her, in that place, at that time. To this day, it amazes me how powerful her presence and the other therapy dogs&#8217; presences were felt.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342058\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342058\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23123844/IMG_1099-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry is a hit with the babies, too!

(Photo courtesy Maura Porter)</p></div>\n<p>Maura and Blueberry&#8217;s journey as a therapy dog team has not been without its hindrances. Until the visit at the site of the Boston Marathon bombing, Maura had not taken Blueberry to Boston for visits due to a law that required dogs like her to be muzzled in public. Thankfully, that law has since changed, but other areas still have similar restrictions.</p>\n<p>Maura&#8217;s closest friend lives in Denver, but she cannot visit her and take Blueberry because <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breeds-pit-bulls-bsl-mutts\" target=\"_blank\">Pit Bulls are banned there</a>. Within the therapy dog world, Maura and Blueberry have been turned away from facilities once they learn Blueberry&#8217;s breed. &#8220;I always say if I can get them to meet her, she will win them over,&#8221; Maura says. While it has been difficult at times to get those initial meetings, everyone who has met Blueberry is left with a positive and lasting impression.</p>\n<p>Now 7 years old, Blueberry continues to change minds, one visit at a time. To follow her adventures as a therapy dog, like her on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blueberry-the-Pit-Bull-Therapy-Dog-Changing-Minds-One-Visit-at-a-Time-218206764888576/?fref=ts\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/houstons-friends-for-life-helps-a-stray-dog-named-mother-mary-give-birth-on-christmas-day\"><b>Houston’s Friends for Life Helps a Stray Dog Named Mother Mary Give Birth on Christmas Day</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-two-amazing-weekend-puppy-raisers-for-a-prison-training-program\"><b>Meet Two Amazing Weekend Puppy Raisers for a Prison Training Program</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\"><b>Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About Meghan Lodge:</strong></em><em> Fits the Aquarius definition to a fault, loves animals, and is always pushing for change.

Two family dogs got loose, they were picked up as strays, the owners were notified, and they went to pick up their dogs. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to work, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Only, it didn&#8217;t work out that way. It nearly did, but our boneheads saw their chance to be mammoth idiots, and they did that job spectacularly. They only picked up one dog. The younger dog.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They left their senior dog behind &#8212; in a high-kill shelter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Cookie is crying for her family. She watched as the family drove away and left her to die,&#8221; said a member of the San Bernardino City Shelter, according to a story in <a href=\"http://blog.fido4ever.com/15-year-old-senior-pup-cries-as-owner-leaves-her-behind-walks-out-with-younger-pup/\" target=\"_blank\">Fido4Ever</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343399\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094535/cookie-11-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"cookie-11\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fortunately, heartless and cruel acts tend to get noticed by people who work at shelters, and the story quickly spread through social media. Soon, she was sprung by <a title=\"OC Small Paws (So UT)\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws (So UT)</a> and placed in a foster home. Fortunately, the bonehead owners had at least surrendered the dog, which allowed her to go to a new home rather than sit through the seven-day stray hold.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What&#8217;s even more shocking about this story is that Cookie appears to have been mistreated as well. She had multiple tumors, her hair was matted, and she smelled &#8220;like trash,&#8221; according to a OC Small Paws Facebook post, leading staff to assume she was &#8220;an outside dog.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It appeared her abandonment had been happening for a while, as she&#8217;d seemingly been tossed in the backyard, ignored.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343398\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094505/bonehead-cookie-1-600x338.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343396\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094502/bonehead-cookie-2-600x360.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-2\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The group arranged for the Cookie to get much-needed medical attention, and multiple tumors were removed, including one the size of a softball. She&#8217;s now doing fine in her foster home, where she&#8217;s going to live out the rest of her days.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws</a> Facebook post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">We have made the collective decision to not adopt her out. She will stay under the care of the rescue for the rest of her life in a local forever foster. She also will be under the care of our vet who has already done her first surgery. &#8230; We appreciate the outpouring of help on her. At this point she is covered. Please if you are able consider helping a local dog that may not be as lucky as Cookie to have an army of people looking out for her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">Check out more photos of Cookie enjoying life with her foster parent:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343394\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094500/bonehead-cookie-4-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-4\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343393\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094458/bonehead-cookie-5-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-5\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343395\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094501/bonehead-cookie-3-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-3\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Photos via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws (So UT) Faceook</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Read about more boneheads:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/this-bonehead-stole-a-yorkshire-terrier-puppy-and-traded-her-for-crack\"><b>This Bonehead Stole a Yorkshire Terrier Puppy and Traded Her for Crack</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/this-bonehead-drove-a-car-through-an-animal-clinic\"><b>This Bonehead Drove a Car Through an Animal Clinic</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/bonehead-handler-dumps-his-retired-police-dog-in-a-kill-shelter\"><b>Bonehead Handler Dumps His Retired Police Dog in a Kill Shelter</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/boneheads-leave-their-senior-dog-in-a-high-kill-shelter-only-take-home-their-younger-dog\">Boneheads Leave Their Senior Dog in a High-Kill Shelter, Only Take Home Their Younger Dog</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com\">Dogster</a>.</p>\n"

We&#8217;re puppies, we don&#8217;t wear helmets &#8212; you&#8217;re gonna hear the crowd noise. But I&#8217;m a German Shepherd. I&#8217;m a working dog. I&#8217;m one of the smartest canines on the field, if not the planet. And when I retire from the Puppy Bowl, I&#8217;ll probably end up being a freakin&#8217; cop.</p>\n<p>So, will I hear the noise? Yes. Will it ruin my focus? Not a chance. My ancestors came to this country without so much as a collar around their neck. I&#8217;m bringing the trophy back to Germany, where the Puppy Bowl probably makes more sense than actual American football. By the way, I&#8217;d like to take this forum to thank my foster parents for undermining my heritage by naming me after the fourth most populous city in America. That was sarcasm, in case your normal-sized ears couldn&#8217;t pick up the frequency.</p>\n<p>But seriously, no &#8212; no concerns over the crowd noise. The referee&#8217;s whistle?

But it&#8217;s not all bad. I have more life experience than any of the other puppies in this game. Football is a fall sport, and I was pretty much the only dog here even alive in the fall. I was getting house trained when these guys were still gestating.</p>\n<p>They say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t teach an old dog new tricks.&#8221; Well, I&#8217;m gonna teach these young ones a thing or two, I promise you that.</p>\n<p>As for if this will be my last game or not &#8212; look, I don&#8217;t worry about the chatter.

Humans crave variety and new taste sensations. From alchemists fruitlessly seeking the elixir vitae to caffeinated drinks, juice cleanses, and craft beer, we have always wanted more from the liquids we consume. Are any of the water alternatives we enjoy safe to share with our dogs?</p>\n<p>What can dogs drink? Dogs are curious, easily bored creatures, whose experience of the world depends in great measure on their mouths and <a title=\"what can dogs drink\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-do-dogs-lick-people\" target=\"_blank\">tongues</a>. They are also opportunistic omnivores, meaning they&#8217;ll happily ingest &#8212; eat or drink &#8212; anything we put in front of them or leave within their reach. Dogs can drink anything, but should they? Let&#8217;s examine some of the most frequently asked questions about dogs and fluids!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink milk?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink alcohol?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink coffee or tea?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink fruit juice?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>How long can a dog go without water?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_342282\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342282\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102347/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-01-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There&#8217;s no substitute for a <a title=\"how much water should a dog drink\" href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/dog-tibetan-terrier-pathetic-water-700227/\" target=\"_blank\">dog drinking water</a>. (Photo via Pixabay)</p></div>\n<h2>Can dogs drink milk?</h2>\n<p>During the first five or six weeks of life, you can reliably find a baby puppy locked onto one of mother&#8217;s teats. Dog milk provides not only essential nutrition to puppies, but also passes along useful antibodies. Once a puppy is weaned, though, and ready to move on solid food, his need for milk and ability to process it diminishes accordingly. Dogs can and will drink milk if it&#8217;s available, but once they reach maturity, adult dogs are largely <a title=\"can dogs drink milk\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-eat-cheese-eggs-ice-cream-drink-milk-dog-health-food\" target=\"_blank\">lactose intolerant</a>. The calcium and protein that dogs derive from milk is capably provided by a quality dog food.</p>\n<p>Does lactose intolerance mean that <a title=\"are dogs lactose intolerant\" href=\"http://www.pfiaa.com.au/Feeding-Pets/Feeding-Milk-to-Pets-and-Lactose-Intolerance.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">dogs cannot drink milk</a> at all? No. For dogs, just as for humans, being lactose intolerant involves not producing sufficient lactase to break down dairy products in large quantities. All milk is not the same, so a dog&#8217;s reaction to cow&#8217;s milk will differ from that of his mother. The worst that the typical dog can expect from drinking more milk than his digestive system can process is temporary digestive upset. A bit of milk on occasion can be a nice treat, but shouldn&#8217;t be depended on as any kind of alternative to water.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink alcohol?</h2>\n<p>Can <a title=\"can dogs get drunk\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-drink-beer-wine-alcohol-ethanol-hops-grapes-poisoning-toxicity\" target=\"_blank\">dogs drink wine</a>, beer, or any other kind of alcoholic beverage? These kinds of questions are asked especially around festive occasions, such as holidays and major sporting events, when dog owners tend to enjoy a tipple. In the vast majority of situations, they are asked out of a kind of heedless curiosity. Some people might find it amusing to see their dog act drunkenly, but there is nothing funny about testing a dog&#8217;s tolerance or subjecting them to alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p><a title=\"is beer bad for dogs\" href=\"http://www.vetstreet.com/dr-marty-becker/is-it-safe-to-give-a-dog-beer\" target=\"_blank\">Dogs can get drunk</a>, and suffer much more debilitating effects from a fraction of the alcohol consumption than the average adult human. Ethanol toxicosis can cause not only motor function impairment, but also lead to problems with heart and lung function. Some of the primary ingredients in wine and beer &#8212; grapes and hops &#8212; are each potentially toxic to dogs in their own right. Alcohol of any variety, whether in the form of wine, beer, or distilled spirits, offers our dogs nothing but deadly danger.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink coffee or tea?</h2>\n<p>As much as I may enjoy a beer after work, when I&#8217;m at work, a mug of coffee is never far from my lips. Are caffeinated beverages, like <a title=\"can dogs drink coffee\" href=\"http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/poison/caffeine/\" target=\"_blank\">coffee or tea</a>, safe to share with dogs? The simple answer is no. Caffeine poisoning poses health risks just as great to dogs as alcohol. Because dogs typically have much less body weight than humans, it takes far less caffeine to negatively impact a dog&#8217;s body, much like with alcohol.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342283\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342283\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102350/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-02-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a title=\"lactose intolerance in dogs\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/_tar0_/5031998865\" target=\"_blank\">Should dogs drink milk</a>? No. (Photo by Taro the Shiba Inu on Flickr)</p></div>\n<p>Found in everything from coffee, tea, and soda to energy drinks, chocolate candy, and nutritional supplements, caffeine is also more readily available and more likely to be accidentally ingested than alcohol. If your dog likes to root around in the same garbage can where you toss your coffee grounds, even these can threaten her health. Where fermented drinks depress a dog&#8217;s vital systems, caffeinated foods and beverages accelerate them beyond acceptable levels. High blood pressure, increased heart rate, and hyperactivity are only a few consequences of <a title=\"can dogs drink soda\" href=\"http://www.banfield.com/pet-health-resources/preventive-care/nutrition/caffeine-is-toxic-to-your-pets\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine toxicity</a> in dogs.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink juice?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s understandable that a dog&#8217;s digestive system is not physically capable of processing lactose, alcohol, and caffeine in the same ways as a human&#8217;s. What about nominally healthier drinks? Surely fruit juices must be safe for dogs to drink? Not so fast! In limited quantities or as an occasional treat, de-seeded <a title=\"can dogs drink orange juice\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-eat-fruit-and-grapes-raisins-dog-health\" target=\"_blank\">apples and oranges</a> are neither toxic or unhealthy for dogs. Store-bought juices or fruit juices from concentrate are another matter.</p>\n<p>If you are making the juice yourself from <a title=\"can dogs drink apple juice\" href=\"http://www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/pmahaney/2013/oct/which-fall-fruits-are-healthiest-for-pets-30994\" target=\"_blank\">fresh fruits</a>, a small bit of these juices should not contain enough natural sugars to upset your dog&#8217;s stomach. The sugars, preservatives, and other chemical additives in even the healthiest fruit juices at the grocery store may put a strain on your dog&#8217;s digestion. If you&#8217;re inclined to offer your dog apple or orange juice, start with a small amount to gauge your dog&#8217;s reaction.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342284\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342284\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102353/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-03-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dogs should not drink <a title=\"what can dogs drink besides water\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-187655531/stock-photo-miniature-dachshund-and-coffee-cup.html\" target=\"_blank\">coffee, tea, or soda</a>. (Photo via Shutterstock)</p></div>\n<h2>Dehydration in dogs can be a serious problem</h2>\n<p>The truth is, once weaned from mother&#8217;s milk, the only beverage a strong and healthy dog needs to stay that way is a steady supply of <a title=\"dehydration in dogs\" href=\"http://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/evr_dg_the_importance_of_water#\" target=\"_blank\">clean, fresh water</a>. While humans derive health, energy, or joy from a variety of fluids, food should provide all the nutrients and energy a dog needs. Dogs don&#8217;t get or require the same kinds of carnal pleasures that we do from milk, coffee, soda, or fruit juices. There is no substitute or alternative drink that does as much for the average dog as water.</p>\n<p>Dehydration can cause just as many problems for dogs as drinking the wrong kinds of beverages. Water contributes substantively to every part of a dog&#8217;s physical life. From the circulatory system to joint mobility and flexibility, and from temperature regulation to energy level, water is essential to your dog&#8217;s health. Keeping your dog properly hydrated means providing them water and keeping their water dishes clean.</p>\n<p>Fresh water is even more important during periods of extreme weather. Be particularly vigilant about your dog&#8217;s water supply during the summer and winter. Since dogs have limited ability to <a title=\"do dogs sweat\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/do-dogs-sweat-dog-panting-glands-health-facts\" target=\"_blank\">sweat</a> and panting uses up a great deal of internal moisture, they should have constant access to water to help them regulate their body heat. In the dead of winter, it&#8217;s just as important to make sure your dog&#8217;s water bowl isn&#8217;t freezing over.</p>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong> Melvin Peña trained as a scholar and teacher of 18th-century British literature before turning his research and writing skills to puppies and kittens.

              "<p>Horses are said to grow long in the tooth as they age. I sometimes quip that dogs do the opposite. As they chew and play with balls (especially abrasive tennis balls) and toys, their teeth wear down. Elderly dogs often grow short in the tooth.</p>\n<p>My very good pal Buster is growing metaphorically short in the tooth. He is now 10 and a half years old. His overall health is very good. He is happy and trim, and he looks younger than many dogs who are only 6 or 7. But age is taking its toll on my pal in one way: He has arthritis.</p>\n<p>For several years, Buster has limped on his left front leg after heavy exercise. X-rays show that he has arthritis in his elbow. He also has significant evidence of degenerative joint disease (which is the formal term used for canine arthritis) in several other joints. He is a <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a> mix. Let&#8217;s face it: Arthritis is almost ubiquitous in old Labs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_334838\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-334838 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16102449/barchas-thumb-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"barchas-thumb\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Eric Barchas and Buster. (Photo by Liz Acosta)</p></div>\n<p>For the last year, I have given Metacam to Buster on heavy activity days. Metacam, also known as meloxicam, is a member of a class of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. It has worked wonders for my pal. He is much more active and comfortable after exercise when he takes the drug.</p>\n<p>Most dogs who take Metacam experience no side effects, and Buster certainly has not shown any clinical evidence of adverse effects. However, Metacam, like all NSAIDs, has the potential to cause upset stomach or, rarely, severe gastrointestinal problems. It also, like almost all drugs, is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys; it can damage them in the process, and the kidneys are especially susceptible. I run blood tests on Buster regularly, and so far there has been no evidence of organ damage. However, I worry about the potential for the medicine to stress his organs &#8212; especially his kidneys &#8212; in the long run.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow the advice that I have always dispensed to clients whose dogs require NSAIDs to enjoy a good quality of life. I use the minimum effective dose. Buster only gets the medicine on days when I think he&#8217;ll be in pain without it. And I use a dose that is lower than the one that is generally recommended.</p>\n<p>However, I wanted to do more to help Buster enjoy a good quality of life and to minimize the use of NSAIDs. I have always provided adequate exercise (to promote strength) and have kept Buster&#8217;s weight at an ideal level (to reduce strain on the joints). About six months ago, I also began to treat Buster with a product called Adequan.</p>\n<p>Adequan is an injectable product containing polysulfated glycosaminoglycans. It is, essentially, injectable glucosamine. It is widely available through veterinarians, who usually can arrange to administer the injections.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343130\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343130\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01083123/shutterstock_329068601-600x240.jpg\" alt=\"Glucosamine by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-329068601/stock-photo-glucosamine-is-an-amino-sugar-and-a-prominent-precursor-in-the-biochemical-synthesis-of.html?src=Ooyycsdk4gCYJCiCp0IjBw-1-3\">Glucosamine</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The so-called induction period for Adequan consists of twice weekly injections for up to four weeks. The medication usually is then used (off-label) every two to four weeks for maintenance therapy.</p>\n<p>I bought a couple of bottles of Adequan and administered Buster&#8217;s induction doses. The difference was remarkable. Buster needed far less Metacam on his heavy activity days. His quality of life also improved in subtle but appreciable ways. He had more of a spring in his step. He was more frisky. He was quicker to greet me at the door. He smiled more. Seriously. Adequan made him a happier dog. His life was much improved.</p>\n<p>Buster received maintenance injections first every two weeks, then every three. I finally reduced his frequency to once a month. Buster&#8217;s most recent dose was due last Monday.</p>\n<p>As I prepared to administer the injection, I second guessed the dose. It had been a month since I last administered the drug. I was 99 percent certain that the dose was 4.4 mg/kg, but 99 percent isn&#8217;t the same as 100 percent. It was time for a quick consultation with Dr. Google. The good doctor promptly directed me to the <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/vet/adequan-canine.html\" target=\"_blank\">drugs.com monograph</a> for the product. The dose was, indeed, 4.4 mg/kg (2 mg/lb).</p>\n<p>I care a lot about my pal&#8217;s health, so I figured that I might as well check out the product&#8217;s safety profile while I had the monograph at the ready. And that&#8217;s when I became pissed off.</p>\n<p>The monograph described a so-called subacute toxicity study. Thirty-four <a title=\"Beagles\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagles</a> were divided into groups and were administered doses of the product at approximately one, three, and 10 times what is recommended for a period of 13 weeks (which is more than three times the recommended duration of induction treatment). And then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Necropsies were performed 24 hours after the final treatment. During week 12, one dog in the 50 mg/kg dosage group developed a large hematoma at the injection site which necessitated euthanasia. No other mortalities occurred during the treatment period.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Necropsy is how veterinarians say autopsy. In other words, the study was a terminal one. The Beagles were euthanized at the end of the study so that they could be dissected and studied.</p>\n<p>Where should I begin? First, let&#8217;s get the results of the study out of the way. They showed a number of minor changes and irregularities that almost certainly are nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about why I got mad. How about the Beagle whose hematoma &#8220;necessitated euthanasia&#8221;? I don&#8217;t buy it. Hematomas are swollen areas under the skin filled with blood. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of hematomas, and I can&#8217;t remember one that necessitated euthanasia. If Buster developed a hematoma as a result of an injection, I&#8217;d explore the myriad treatment options &#8212; ranging from intermittent drainage to pressure and warm compresses to indwelling drain placement to en bloc surgical resection &#8212; that are available. The Beagle&#8217;s hematoma most likely did not <em>necessitate</em> euthanasia &#8212; rather, the researchers <em>elected</em> to euthanize rather than treat, probably (in my speculative opinion) because the dog was going to be euthanized soon anyway.</p>\n<p>And how about the fact that all of the dogs in the study were members of one breed? <a title=\"Beagles traditionally are the standard breed used for research in dogs\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/beagle-freedom-project-lab-animal-testing\" target=\"_blank\">Beagles traditionally are the standard breed used for research in dogs</a>. Beagles are dogs, and my dog is a dog, but my dog is not a Beagle. Might the drug affect Lab-mutts differently?</p>\n<p>And now for the real meat of the matter: Why was the study a terminal one? I don&#8217;t know with certainty, but I have a pretty strong hunch.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343128\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343128\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01082651/shutterstock_304277162-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Beagle in a cage by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-304277162/stock-photo-dog-behind-the-cage.html?src=9GzYcaPCBV8fUPuZQmA6Qw-1-13\">Beagle in a cage</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The best study would have followed hundreds or thousands of dogs over many years. They would have been monitored clinically, and blood and urine parameters would have been measured regularly. They would have died of other causes, and their lifespans and autopsy results would have been compared statistically.</p>\n<p>That study would have cost a lot of money. And it would have delayed the release of the product by many years. The Beagle study only lasted 13 weeks, and evidently was sufficient for FDA approval. I&#8217;ll allow you to draw your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for my pal Buster, Adequan has been on the market for many years. Many, many thousands of dogs have taken the product, and no serious complications have been discovered. The best study, in effect, has been run through the use of the product. Adequan appears safe.</p>\n<p>However, I must admit to a feeling of moral conflict. Adequan has helped Buster immensely, but if I continue to use it I will be supporting the corporation that ran the terminal Beagle study. Should I continue to use it? Fortunately, my pal&#8217;s next dose is not due for thee weeks, so I have some time to mull it over.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hear from you, readers?

Instead, James Franco is actually a terrier mutt who&#8217;s been happily living his life in San Francisco.

              "<p>As a kid, I loved playing games. Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly… you name it, I was up for a round or two.</p>\n<p>And then I grew up and no longer found games fun because of how seriously some adults take them. During my 20s, one friend in particular liked to gather a group for Trivial Pursuit. She and her partner would memorize the questions ahead of time and proceed to crush the rest of us. I passed on that invite more often than not.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t actually played a game with other adults until recently, when <a title=\"Earth Rated\" href=\"http://www.earthrated.com/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Earth Rated</a> sent me its limited-edition Cards Against Caninity. The unofficial expansion pack for <a title=\"Cards Against Humanity\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CardsAgainstHumanity/\" target=\"_blank\">Cards Against Humanity</a> not only puts a canine spin on the wildly popular game, but it helps keep shelter dogs warm!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343146\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01092843/Combo_NiceThings-600x306.jpg\" alt=\"Combo_NiceThings\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343147\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01092844/2016-01-30-REMINDER-Combo_Dreaming-600x306.jpg\" alt=\"2016-01-30-REMINDER-Combo_Dreaming\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /></p>\n<p>For a chance to win the game, simply nominate a U.S. or Canadian shelter to receive a case of Earth Rated fleece blankets. The company will give away 1,000 packs and 50 cases of blankets.</p>\n<p>So, is Cards Against Caninty as fun as its inspiration? Which involves one player picking a question card and the others picking the answer he or she might like best? It is! I invited over my game-loving neighbors Dennis, Kate, and Bubba the <a title=\"Pug\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Pug\" target=\"_blank\">Pug</a> for a round. Dennis and Kate said it’s closer to the more family friendly <a title=\"Apples to Apples\" href=\"http://shop.mattel.com/product/index.jsp?productId=49830716\" target=\"_blank\">Apples to Apples</a>, while Bubba was more interested in the bag of treats I had handy to keep him and my two dogs, Spot and Dolly, entertained.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343153\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343153\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01093212/IMG_0705-1-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Bubba the Pug. \" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bubba the <a title=\"Pug\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Pug\" target=\"_blank\">Pug</a> did not help Kate win.

Saving money sometimes feels impossible, but it can be done. To help give us all a jumpstart, I reached out to budget experts who spend their entire careers gathering tips on the best way to stretch a dollar. I asked each of them for one of their favorite ways to save on pet expenses. They didn’t disappoint!</p>\n<h3>Use discount gift cards and loyalty programs</h3>\n<p>Andrea Woroch is a nationally recognized consumer and money-savings expert for Kinoli Inc., not to mention a loving dog mom. When Andrea shops for her <a title=\"Goldendoodle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/goldendoodle\" target=\"_blank\">Goldendoodle</a>, Bauer, she doubles up whenever possible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341524\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341524\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144529/dog-money-roll-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"(Image courtesy OTA Photos/Flickr\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dog with dollars by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/101332430@N03/21225816748/\">OTA Photos/Flickr</a>.</p></div>\n<p>First, she hits discount gift card sites like <a href=\"http://GiftCardGranny.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gift Card Granny</a>, where you can purchase gift cards to pet-supply stores for up to 30 percent off. No one said gift cards can’t be gifts to yourself!</p>\n<p>Gift Card Granny pulls together a number of card exchange sites allowing you to compare shop on gift cards. These exchange sites purchase unwanted gift cards from consumers and then turn around and sell them to you. The percentage you can get off a card varies, so using Gift Card Granny helps you find the best deal out there.</p>\n<p>The next step is to sign up for loyalty programs at pet-supply stores you frequent. My keychain has so many mini loyalty cards attached to it that I have to double check with the checkout person where I am, so I can hand over the correct one!</p>\n<p>Loyalty programs work differently for each store but almost always guarantee you weekly in-store deals. In addition, many loyalty programs reward you with additional savings the more you spend. Petco’s <a href=\"http://www.petco.com/pals-rewards\" target=\"_blank\">Pals Rewards</a>, for example, gives you five reward dollars for each $100 you spend.</p>\n<h3>Buy prescriptions online</h3>\n<p>Regina Conway, consumer expert for <a href=\"http://Slickdeals.net\" target=\"_blank\">Slickdeals.net</a> and the proud pet parent to her adorable mixed-breed dog, Cricket, shared one of my favorite tips: Don’t purchase prescriptions from your vet. Of course, if your dog needs medication immediately, don’t hesitate to turn to your vet’s office. But ask if you can get a prescription, especially for ongoing medications, including flea and heartworm medication, and other high-cost drugs.</p>\n<p>Shop around for a better price with one of the many online veterinary pharmacies, such as <a href=\"http://www.1800petmeds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1-800-PetMeds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drsfostersmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drs. Foster &amp; Smith</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.petrescuerx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pet Rescue Rx</a>, which donates 100 percent of its net profits to rescues and shelters of the customer’s choice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341526\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341526\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144532/dog-shopping-cart-600x452.jpg\" alt=\"Dog with shopping cart by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244349002.html&amp;src=download_history\">Dog with shopping cart</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>I once had to take a dog in my care to the vet to remove part of a tick that I had failed to fully get out. As a precaution, he put her on medication for <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/lyme-disease-in-dogs-dog-health-tips-symptoms-treatment-ticks-borrelia-burgdorferi\" target=\"_blank\">Lyme disease.</a> The vet didn’t stock it, so he sent me to my pharmacy to get it filled. When I received the quote from the pharmacy, I almost passed out. I purchased just enough to last me until I could have the medicine delivered by an online source. The savings were enormous!</p>\n<p>On the flip side, sometimes certain drugs cost less when purchased from a human pharmacy compared to buying them from your vet or even a vet pharmacy. Do your research before buying.</p>\n<h3>Compare before you buy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kimberly-palmer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Palmer</a>, author of <em>The Economy of You</em> (AMACOM, 2014), brought this tip — probably taught to you by your frugal grandfather — to the Internet age. Comparing before making online purchases is key. It’s something, admittedly, I don’t do enough of. But the cost of a product can vary considerably depending on who is selling it.</p>\n<p>This principle applies to in-store purchases, too. The same can of dog food will have a different price at your grocery store, big box store like Target or Walmart, or pet-supply store. Regina advised checking prices online before purchasing in store. Pet supplies are often less expensive when purchased online (don’t forget to note the cost of shipping).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341527\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341527\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144534/puppy-dollars-600x473.jpg\" alt=\"Puppy surrounded by money by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"473\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-116787223.html&amp;src=download_history\">Puppy surrounded by money</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>For even more online savings, search for coupon codes (digital coupons redeemable at checkout) on websites like <a href=\"http://www.retailmenot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RetailMeNot</a>. Kimberly suggested looking at the app <a href=\"http://redlaser.com/application/\" target=\"_blank\">RedLaser</a> to compare online prices and <a href=\"http://www.getinvisiblehand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">InvisibleHand</a>, a browser add-on that helps ensure you’re getting the lowest online prices available. Excuse me while I go download Invisible Hand right now!</p>\n<h3>More easy tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up for emails from your favorite retailers so you can stay up to date on their sales.</li>\n<li>Clip coupons from the Sunday paper. You can also print coupons from your computer (check out <a href=\"http://thekrazycouponlady.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Krazy Coupon Lady</a> for a searchable database of printable coupons).</li>\n<li>Buy dog food in bulk. Try splitting the cost/amount with neighbors or friends.</li>\n<li>Learn to groom your dog yourself. One trip to the groomer can be the same cost as purchasing the tools you need to do the job yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Read related stories on Dogster:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-care-how-to-save-money-expenses-food-grooming-vets-tips\"><b>How to Save Money on Dog Expenses</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/6-ways-how-to-save-money-pet-dog-expenses\"><b>6 Ways to Save Money on Pet Expenses</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/10-tips-for-saving-money-on-pet-expenses\"><b>10 Tips for Saving Money on Pet Expenses </b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author: </i></b><a href=\"http://wendyandriggins.com/\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Wendy Newell</i></span></a><i> is a former VP of Sales turned Grade A Dog Sitter.

It made some sense, as my washing machine in my old apartment was located in a closet at the end of the small, galley-style kitchen. But I had left the hamper in the dining area. I thought it was odd, picked it up, and went on my way.</p>\n<p>I should have known better. I have a <a title=\"Beagle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagle</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342729\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342729\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27105853/lulu-begging-600x398.jpeg\" alt=\"My Beagle, Lulu. (Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My Beagle, Lulu. (Photo by Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>A week later, I found an empty lamb-lung treat bag hidden behind the couch. It hadn’t been ripped apart, but expertly opened and emptied.</p>\n<p>Lightbulb! The laundry hamper. I’d had an opened lamb-lung treat bag on a counter in the kitchen. But I kept it in the back, away from prying noses and teeth and paws. Or so I thought. Lulu must have used the hamper to get to the bag.</p>\n<p>My Beagle, for her part, regarded me with a tail wag and a head tilt. How could I get mad? At this point, she wouldn’t even know why I was upset. And she looked too darn cute.</p>\n<p>If you have a dog, chances are good you can sympathize. Maybe you have a similar story. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breeds-beagle-beguiling-buddy-super-sniffer\" target=\"_blank\">But if you own a Beagle</a>, it’s almost a certainty you know what I deal with.</p>\n<p>Beagles are often falsely depicted as being unintelligent. This is patently false. Beagles are brilliant. They’re just stubborn. And when it comes to food, they are evil geniuses. Doggy supervillains.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342732\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342732 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110444/lulu-lamb-lung-bag-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulo loves lamb lung.

Sure, it was in plain sight, but I’d kept it there for months and Lulu never showed any interest, and she couldn’t reach anyway.</p>\n<p>One night, I came home from work to find a brand-new pack on the floor. I had just bought the six-pack and given her one chewable. The other five pills were now missing. The package was not mangled, either. Each pill pocket was opened as if I’d done it myself. All gone. Happy, tail-wagging Lulu. Panicking me.</p>\n<p>The Heartgard site had no info on whether Lulu was in any danger. Nothing on the poison control website I checked. So I called the emergency vet, who promptly laughed. “Honey, she can eat more than one package and nothing will happen.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, eating six pills in one day won’t provide you with six months of heartworm protection. Back to the vet for another pack.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we moved to a house. Lulu could go out and run around in the backyard. The trouble was getting her to come back in. Now, Lulu has a fairly good recall. But suddenly she was refusing to come inside.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342734\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342734\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110614/lulu-silly-600x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Lulu loves her backyard. (Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulu loves being outside. (Photo by Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>If I were coming home at a reasonable hour, I would just let her stay out there. But I come home late at night. Eventually I’d like to go to bed. So I started offering a treat to bring her in.</p>\n<p>Now she would rather stay outside all day and night than come in without getting a treat. Sometimes she’ll even refuse to come in if the treat bribe isn’t to her liking.</p>\n<p>Lulu is also good at catching me when my guard is down.</p>\n<p>One day, I was washing my other dog, Jasmine, a chore that involves high-value treats to coax her into the bathroom. The kind of treats that gets Lulu’s <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-facts-sense-of-smell\" target=\"_blank\">super-powered sniffer going. </a>(Beagles have around 225 million scent receptors. Few dog breeds have better noses.)</p>\n<p>When the bath was over, Jasmine flew past me and my towel. I rushed out to grab her before she began dousing the couch with eau du wet dog.</p>\n<p>While I wrestled with the zooming mutt, I heard a rustling. I’d left the bag of treats on top of the toilet. By the time I got back to the bathroom, they were gone, along with Lulu.</p>\n<p>Another time was really dumb on my part and could have been quite dangerous. Parties can be the worst when you have a dog. I had some friends and family over for my birthday. The dogs seemed more interested in meeting all the newcomers than what we were grilling, and at one point no one was minding the food table. So Lulu helped herself to some chicken breast. Thank goodness there were no bones. Needless to say, Lulu spent the rest of the day inside.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342730\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342730\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110057/lulu-after-chicken-600x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Lulu loved the chicken. (Photo courtesy Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulu loves chicken. (Photo courtesy Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>Lulu’s greatest scheme, however, is the one everyone else falls for. Those big, sad eyes. To the Beagle novice, they are irresistible. Who can say no to a begging Beagle? Certainly not my Dad, and boy Lulu knows it. He was watching her while I was away at a conference once, and I came home to find him absentmindedly feeding her Cheetos.</p>\n<p>“Don’t feed her that!” I yelled. “But she likes them!” he exclaimed. Oy.</p>\n<p>It’s not just my father who falls under Lulu’s spell.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a year, Lulu may attend four or five pet-related events – fairs, conferences, expos. Lots of vendors with samples for dogs. Over the years, I’ve discovered a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>None of these people can resist big Beagle eyes and a white-tipped, wagging tail.</li>\n<li>Nothing gets a crowd to come to a booth like a Beagle willing to do basically anything for a treat.<br />\nUsually after a few hours, I turn treat vendors down or offer to take a sample for later. You should see the disappointment in their eyes! It rivals the disappointment in Lulu’s eyes when she realizes I’ve put my foot down.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So remember, if you see us coming and you fall for Lulu’s soulful eyes, know that while she may act like she’s never eaten a day in her life, in her mind she’s really thinking, “Sucker!”</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more funny stuff:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-your-dogs-breed-says-about-you\"><b>What Your Dog’s Breed Says About You</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/22-signs-that-you-might-be-a-helicopter-pet-parent\"><b>22 Signs That You Might Be a Helicopter Pet Parent</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-the-hilarious-kid-president-and-his-first-dog-annie-the-chihuahua\"><b>Meet the Hilarious Kid President and His First Dog, Annie the Chihuahua</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Christie Zizo is a writer in Orlando, Florida.

Solid yellows are sometimes seen, but because they are not approved per the standard, and cannot be shown in conformation, they have been strongly selected against.

That’s when a photo of Nana appeared in her feed and changed her life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just looked so sad and &#8212; I hate to say this word &#8212; really truly pathetic.

She was around 8 years old when she was surrendered to a Los Angeles city shelter. Thin and dirty with nipples hanging down to her knees, veterinarians who examined Nana estimated that she’d had between 12 and 15 litters before being dropped off. Her ears were terribly infected and disfigured, likely the result of an at-home ear cropping. Her teeth were nothing but nubs, having been filed down either by human hands or her own actions as she chewed a chain or metal crate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s hard to imagine a dog who someone had for eight years could be in that condition,” says Doris. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senior Pit with medical needs, Nana wasn’t exactly the most adoptable dog in the shelter. Being kept in medical isolation made her chances even worse &#8212; she wasn’t visible to visitors. Facebook was Nana’s only chance to get noticed and get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a rescue volunteer, Doris was used to having her social media feeds dominated by photos of dogs in need and had learned not to react emotionally to every picture posted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You just can’t bring home every single dog,” she explains. At the time, Doris was a graduate student living at home with her parents and her first rescue dog, a young <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\" target=\"_blank\">German Shepard</a> mix named Zyra. She says she was in no position to adopt another dog, so she didn’t usually let her heart take over when shelter dogs stared back at her from the screen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was just something about Nana that broke through that wall,” she explains.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342894\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28141701/nana-doris-zyra-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Nana got her happy ending with Doris and Zyra.

It was all infection and bacteria, and they smelled awful,” Nana’s human recalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fostering a sick, sad Pit Bull with a sketchy past didn’t sound like a great idea to Doris’ parents at first, but they soon followed in the daughter’s footsteps and fell in love with Nana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For the first two months, we just focused on her health; she wasn’t really adoptable,” says Doris, who had her hands full with Nana’s medical issues.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342895\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342895 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28142042/nana-ears-600x433.jpg\" alt=\"Nana's ears were causing her serious pain. \" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nana&#8217;s ears were causing her serious pain. (Photo courtesy Nana the Earless Pibble)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the infection in her ears, Nana also has issues with her skin and fungus on her paws. Over time, Nana developed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drug-resistant bacterial infections &#8212; MRSA and Pseudomonas &#8212; in her ears. She was in constant pain, and it was clear the ears were not salvageable. Eventually she had two surgeries, a bilateral total ear canal ablation and a bulla osteotomy, during which two pounds of scar tissue and inflammation were removed from her ears. The surgeries left Nana deaf, but she was happier than Doris had ever seen her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When she was no longer in pain, she just totally blossomed,” says Doris, who remembers seeing Nana play with toys and vocalize for the first time after her surgeries. “Even to this day, she continues to blossom.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342899\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342899 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28143240/nana-grass-600x459.jpg\" alt=\"nana grass\" width=\"600\" height=\"459\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Three years after being saved from the shelter, Nana is loving life. (Photo courtesy Nana the Earless Pibble)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer in pain, Nana started learning how to be a dog. Taking cues from then-2-year-old Zyra, Nana grew more confident and playful with each passing day. Although she’d initially been fearful of men, she developed a strong bond with Doris’ father. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My dad just fell absolutely head over heels for Nana. I credit him with pushing me to keep her.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months after springing Nana from the shelter, Doris was regularly taking her foster dog to adoption events, but her dad was starting to think the adorable senior Pit should stay put. According to Doris, Nana had just been diagnosed with dermal hemangiosarcoma, an aggressive skin cancer, and her father didn’t want the dog bouncing around from home to home. Still, Doris and Nana continued to attend adoption events. People frequently asked about Nana’s story and (to Doris’ dismay) if she had puppies available, but no potential adopters came forward. Then, one day, an adopter finally expressed interest in Nana, and Doris realized that her father was right &#8212; this dog had already found her forever human.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Doris by her side, Nana fought her cancer and completed chemotherapy. With Nana by her side, Doris moved to Nevada for medical school. Together, the pair have become well-known advocates for Pit Bulls. In 2014, Doris (who had never heard of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/6-ways-you-can-fight-breed-specific-legislation-in-your-community\" target=\"_blank\">breed specific legislation</a> or the staggering Pit Bull euthanization statistics before meeting Nana) spoke in front of a crowd at the <a href=\"http://www.standupforpits.us/one-million-pibble-march-on-washington-dc/\" target=\"_blank\">One Million Pibble March</a> in Washington.  </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342896\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342896\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28142457/nana-dc-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Nana advocating in D.C.

(Photo courtesy Nana the Earless Pibble)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s clear Nana’s story is making an impact on the world. When people tell Doris how they wish they had a dog like Nana, she’s happy to tell them that plenty are available in shelters and rescues. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are so many other dogs just like Nana, who have just as awful backgrounds, who are just waiting for someone to open up their homes &#8212; even if it’s temporary &#8212; just to give them love,” says Doris.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Monday Miracles:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/maggie-the-potcake-pup-finds-her-best-friend-and-a-forever-home\"><b>Maggie the “Potcake Pup” Finds Her Best Friend and a Forever Home</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/once-paralyzed-jimmy-the-pit-bull-wants-to-walk-into-a-forever-home\"><b>Once-Paralyzed Jimmy the Pit Bull Is Ready to Walk Into His Forever Home</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/chipper-goes-from-therapy-dog-failure-to-social-media-star\"><b>Chipper Goes From Therapy Dog Failure to Social Media Star</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><i>About the author: </i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Heather Marcoux is a freelance writer in Alberta, Canada.

When they called us and asked us to help, of course we said yes.”</p>\n<p>Being a resource for the community and providing care to homeless animals are a part of the mission of Friends for Life. It was founded in 2002 by executive director Salise Shuttlesworth and is a no-kill alternative to traditionally run shelter facilities in the area.</p>\n<p>Lawson said Mother Mary came under the care of Friends for Life just before Christmas. Because of her obvious advanced pregnancy, volunteers worked to make sure she was comfortable and not placed around the other dogs. “When dogs are pregnant, they like their space,” Lawson said. So, a warm space was created just for her in the shower area of the facility’s wellness department.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341261\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341261 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17101122/600x457-600x457.jpg\" alt=\"Friends for Life stepped in to help Mother Mary, a stray dog, who was being fed by neighbors and about ready to give birth.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Calling it nothing short of a Christmas miracle, Lawson explained, “Mother Mary actually started giving birth on Christmas. She delivered 12 puppies, and it was ongoing and all day. Certain members of our staff and volunteers were actually there to witness some of the births because it lasted a while and she gave birth to so many.”</p>\n<p>The litter consisted of eight female and four male puppies. A popular Christmas song provided the inspiration for the they names: Turtledove, Drummer, Piper, Leaper, Dancer, Milky, Swan, Goose, Ringer, Birdy, Henna, and Partridge.</p>\n<p>Lawson said that, unfortunately, one of the puppies didn’t survive. “We lost Turtledove.”</p>\n<p>Currently, Mother Mary and her puppies are being fostered offsite by a Friends for Life staff member. Lawson said that the foster mother is equipped to take care of the babies and makes sure they are all getting adequate nutrition as they continue to grow and start to open their eyes. “It&#8217;s nice to have them in a safe home where they are not overwhelmed with all of the other activity at the shelter,” she added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341262\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341262 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17101159/600x337-600x337.jpg\" alt=\"Not long after she was brought under the care of Friends for Life, Mother Mary began to give birth to 12 puppies on Christmas Day.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Since the rescue is located at 107 E. 22nd Street in Houston, Lawson said, “This was our own little miracle on 22nd Street. It was too perfect, especially when she started to give birth on Christmas morning.”</p>\n<p>In addition to helping Mother Mary and her litter, Friends for Life is striving to advance its mission by continuing to reach out to the community and helping other animals in need.</p>\n<p>Shuttlesworth said that last year, the rescue gave away more than two tons of food through its food bank. Friends for Life also underwrote more than 1,300 free surgeries for animals of residents in underserved neighborhoods, which prevented more than 26,000 animal births, she said.</p>\n<p>When Friends for Life came into existence, she explained, “It offered a progressive choice to Houstonians who believe we can do better. We have proven that those ‘unadoptable’ animals are, in fact, adoptable, and that 75 percent of the animals we have placed in loving homes would not have made it to the adoption room floor at traditional shelters.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342906\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342906\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28150114/ffl-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"Friends For Life Houston is the also the only LEED-certified no-kill animal shelter in Texas.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, Shuttlesworth said, “We intend to continue to expand the mentorships and partnerships in the community. We look forward to opening a veterinary clinic on the property we have purchased adjacent to our current facility, which will serve greater Houston.”</p>\n<p>She added that by providing accessibly priced veterinary medical services, more people will be able to take better care of their animals and won&#8217;t have to take an animal to a shelter in the first place. Or have their dog end up on the streets, pregnant and looking for a safe place to have their puppies.</p>\n<p>Check out Friends for Life on <a title=\"Friends for Life\" href=\"http://www.adoptfriends4life.org/\" target=\"_blank\">its website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FriendsForLifeHouston/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adoptfriends4life/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram.</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-two-amazing-weekend-puppy-raisers-for-a-prison-training-program\"><b>Meet Two Amazing Weekend Puppy Raisers for a Prison Training Program</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\"><b>Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/collide-nyc-helps-homeless-youth-care-for-their-pets\"><b>Collide NYC Helps Homeless Youth Care for Their Pets</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>About the author</em></strong><em>: Anne Forline is a freelance writer in Bellmawr, New Jersey.

However, we were recently given the <a href=\"http://www.piddleplace.com/piddleplace/\" target=\"_blank\">Piddle Place Pet Relief System</a> to try.</p>\n<p>The system is a sturdy, rectangular plastic contraption that is more or less a litter box for dogs. It is almost flat, with an artificial grass mat placed on top. To eliminate odors, there is a bio-enzyme liquid that you mix with water and place inside the base, and you can replace the solution every week to keep things fresh.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340281\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340281\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10144639/Piddle-Place-inspected-by-Ezio-600x620.jpg\" alt=\"Our cat, Ezio, was quite curious about the Piddle Place Pet Relief System.

As things tend to go, right about the time I was going to give up, I witnessed Ruby, our 4-pound <a title=\"Chihuahua\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Chihuahua\" target=\"_blank\">Chihuahua</a>, waddle over and pee right on top of it. Victory!</p>\n<p>I am not sure if Ruby finally just got used to it or if it was because I placed a potty pad on top, but once she started peeing on it, she continued to do so, and our other dogs followed suit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342717\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342717\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27103909/IMG_1597-600x751.jpg\" alt=\"Go Ruby! (Photo by Kezia Willingham)\" width=\"600\" height=\"751\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Go, Ruby! (Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>Compared to potty pads, I would say the advantage of the Piddle Place Pet Relief System is that it is more environmentally friendly and less expensive over time than potty pads. It is small enough to fit nicely inside most apartments, townhouses, and condos. If you live in a building that requires you to use several flights of stairs or an elevator to get outside, a Piddle Place inside your home is a good option.</p>\n<h3>Dogster Scorecard for Piddle Place Pet Relief System</h3>\n<p><strong>Quality:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System appears well made and sturdy. The one thing that bothered me a little was that the artificial turf slides off the base pretty easily and slips onto the floor. Also, one of my cats or dogs (not sure who) chewed some of it, and I worry a little about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> It does not take up too much room. I am fairly certain no one would find it amazingly good-looking, but it&#8217;s not horrendous, either.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System is definitely functional. I had to place a potty pad on top to get my dogs started, but I think it is a useful tool, especially if you are just getting ready to adopt a small dog and <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/house-training-a-puppy-tips-tricks-advice-dog-behavior\" target=\"_blank\">plan to train her from the start </a>to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Creativity:</strong> Whoever came up with this idea certainly had a creative approach in thinking of a reusable, environmentally conscious indoor potty-system for pets.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System can be ordered online through a variety of different companies, including <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Piddle-Place-Relief-System-Removable/dp/B007AJZ46Y\">Amazon</a>. It is about $100, which is reasonable, considering that it is reusable and can last for years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340287\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340287\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10145911/Ruby-600x716.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby was the first of our dogs to try Piddle Place.

(Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>As pet owner, I think it is good to have as many tools on hand as possible in order to provide your pets with opportunities to be successful, whether you are assisting them with bathroom, food, or medical needs. The Piddle Place Pet Relief System is a great choice for environmentally conscious, small-dog pet parents. The system may not work as well for larger dogs.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the Piddle Place Pet Relief System on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.piddleplace.com/piddleplace/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Read more Dogster Reviews:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/the-active-pack-tests-kurgos-car-safety-products-for-dogs-and-drivers\"><b>The Active Pack Tests Kurgo’s Car Safety Products for Dogs and Drivers</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/riggins-and-friends-review-the-adventure-dog-heeler-first-aid-kit\"><b>Riggins and Friends Review the Adventure Dog Heeler First Aid Kit</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/sydney-and-sassy-get-their-puppy-nails-cut-with-the-zen-clipper\"><b>Sydney and Sassy Get Their Puppy Nails Cut With the Zen Clipper</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About Kezia Willingham:</strong> Also known as the Breadwinning Laundry Queen, Kezia lives in Seattle with her family, which includes a pack of rescued cats and dogs.

It&#8217;s important to do what you can during this life transition to help your dog feel safe, loved, and secure.</p>\n<p>My dog, Riggins, wasn&#8217;t always &#8220;my&#8221; dog. He was &#8220;our&#8221; dog. The &#8220;our&#8221; in the equation was my boyfriend and myself. We lived together in an apartment in Los Angeles. Although our separation was due to a number of things, Riggins was indeed one of them. My boyfriend wasn&#8217;t happy when I had to travel for work and he was obligated to come home and walk the dog. Obviously not someone I could stay with!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341452\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341452 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232337/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_4-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"helping your dog through a breakup_4\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins as a puppy. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>The breakup was hard on Riggins. Truthfully, at the time, I didn&#8217;t take Riggins&#8217; feelings into account. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-my-dog-has-pulled-me-through-dark-periods-in-my-life\" target=\"_blank\">I leaned on him emotionally</a>, and he was always there for me, but I didn&#8217;t take any steps to help him in the transition.</p>\n<p>Even now, eight-plus years later, I think that fact that Riggins is drawn to men at the dog park, where he <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dogs-need-for-stranger-love\" target=\"_blank\">forces them to give him love and attention</a>, is because of his daddy-abandonment issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341453\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341453\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232632/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_5-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins saddles up to a stranger during a hike.

(Photo by Wendy Newell.)</p></div>\n<p>What should I have done to help Riggins out during this difficult time in our lives?</p>\n<p>I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KristinvonKreislerAuthor\" target=\"_blank\">Kristin von Kreisler</a> to get some suggestions. Kreisler is an author of the upcoming novel <em><a href=\"http://kristinvonkreisler.com/books/earnest/\" target=\"_blank\">Earnest</a></em>. The title character, a loyal <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a>, who Kreisler describes as &#8220;eager to please,&#8221; &#8220;sweet,&#8221; &#8220;wonderful,&#8221; and &#8220;devoted,&#8221; goes through a breakup with his human parents. In preparation for the novel, which was inspired by the real life story of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/fighting-for-your-dog-in-a-divorce\" target=\"_blank\">Stanley and Linda Perkins of San Diego, who spent more than $100,000 in a custody battle over their Greyhound mix</a>, Kreisler interviewed vets, people who had lived through a breakup where a pet was involved, and even Maggie, a neighborhood yellow Labrador Retriever who Earnest gets many of his personality traits from.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341448\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341448\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18231315/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_1-600x803.jpg\" alt=\"Kreisler and Maggie. (Courtesy of Kristin von Kreisler.)\" width=\"600\" height=\"803\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristin von Kreisler and Maggie. (Photo courtesy Kristin von Kreisler)</p></div>\n<p>Kreisler explains, &#8220;They [animals] lose their sense of safety and security when their family is broken. It&#8217;s really, really hard.&#8221; Her mission with her novel<em> Earnest</em> is to help readers &#8220;grow in their understanding and sensitivity of what dogs go through when their worlds fall apart.&#8221; Through her research, Kreisler has come up with suggestions on how to help your dog through a breakup.</p>\n<h3>1. Don&#8217;t fight in front of the dog</h3>\n<p>Keisler explains, &#8220;Dogs are so sensitive, and they read our feelings even better than we do, I think.&#8221; She explains that this attunement is when animals not only read feelings but take it a step further and get in tune and in sync with what you are feeling. Empathy in its purest form.</p>\n<p>If you are arguing or becoming aggregated, put the dog in the other room, go outside, or leave the house completely.</p>\n<p>I know from personal experience that Riggins responds to my emotions, and, at least once, <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/have-you-ever-lost-it-at-the-vets-office-when-your-dog-was-sick\" target=\"_blank\">my anxiety has meant a trip to the vet</a> when he fed off what I was feeling.</p>\n<h3>2. Alter your dog&#8217;s routine as little as possible</h3>\n<p>The more you can keep your dog&#8217;s life the same, the easier it will be for him to get used to his new life. Keisler suggests making changes slowly. If moving, take your dog to the new place a few times prior, making it a fun and happy experience for him. Put moving materials like boxes out for a while before packing so they aren&#8217;t seen as something negative. If possible, take your dog to a stable environment he is used to throughout the change in housing. For example, a dog park or doggie daycare.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341451\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341451 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232203/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_3-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"helping your dog through a breakup_3\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins and me during a past move. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<h3>3. Arrange for visits</h3>\n<p>Visits with your ex can help your dog know he has not been abandoned. Make it extra special when your ex leaves and give your dog a treat. The person&#8217;s exit will become a time to celebrate and eat tasty things!</p>\n<p>Although Riggins loves anything food-related and would, no doubt, be up for goodbye treats, there was no way I was going to let my ex near me, him, or our new place. Keisler wouldn&#8217;t be happy with me saying this. She would, no doubt, tell me to put aside my own anger and bitterness and do what is best for Riggins. Luckily, my ex didn&#8217;t want to have visitation, so it was a moot point!</p>\n<h3>4. If sharing custody, minimize the confusion and uncertainty</h3>\n<p>Keep a united front in front of the children! Agree on some rules beforehand: When the dog is fed and bathed, whether he can sleep in the human bed, what kind of dog food he eats, and whether he is allowed human food. Make sure to go through each of these things and come to an agreement you can both stick to.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341454\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341454\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18233448/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_6-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins enjoys a special treat (frozen chicken broth)celebrating his first birthday in his own backyard. (Photo by Wendy Newell.)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins enjoys a special treat (frozen chicken broth) celebrating his first birthday in his own backyard. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<h3>5. If there is a custody dispute, protect the dog during the battle</h3>\n<p>Although some judges are starting to look at dogs like children and awarding custody based on what is best for the dog, this isn&#8217;t always the case. Many judges see pets as property to be split up. Keisler explains that in some cases, the judge has brought the dog into the courtroom, put a parent on each side, and had them both call out to see who the dog went to. She mentions a case that she read about in which the dog was so confused and upset, he ran to the judge!</p>\n<p>To minimize trauma to your pet, think about what will be best for him. Which one of you is home the most, has the biggest backyard, is stable financially enough to take care of vet bills and other finances related to owning a dog? In short, Keisler suggests, &#8220;Think about what is best for the animal. Leave your ego at the door.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>6. Before adopting a dog as a couple, plan for a breakup</h3>\n<p>It may sound cynical, but Keisler points out that 50 percent of marriages in the U.S. now end in divorce and 40 percent of couples who live together will split up within the first five years. Let&#8217;s be honest, the numbers aren&#8217;t pretty. Keisler suggests, &#8220;Even if you think this is the love of your life, think from the very start of the dog&#8217;s best interest.&#8221; That means a pre-adoption agreement that goes over the ins and outs of co-parenting after your relationship is over.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341449\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341449 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18231316/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_2.jpg\" alt=\"Earnest.

(Photo courtesy Kristin von Kreisler)</p></div>\n<p>Keisler&#8217;s final tip is to look for behavior changes in your dog. Some dogs show signs of anxiety, like clinging to an owner, chewing furniture, lack of appetite, or having accidents in the home. If your dog&#8217;s behavior continues to be worrisome or is at any time is drastic, check in with your vet.</p>\n<p><em>Earnest</em> is in stores now.

It was a Saturday, a day my ex often came over to visit us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341191\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341191 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124111/trucker-looking-out-of-upstairs-window-Custom-2-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"trucker looking out of upstairs window (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker watching out of his favorite upstairs window. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>His visits were not only treasured by me, but Trucker loved him. When his SUV pulled into my driveway, Trucker seemed to sense his presence. He’d burst into a flurry of excitement, whimpering with joy to greet him outside or at the back door. Trucker would stop dead in his tracks and sit up on his hind legs, placing his front paws on my ex’s legs to receive and give a hug.</p>\n<p>My ex had three dogs, and he started sharing their dog biscuits with Trucker. Trucker loved the biscuits so much that my ex started carrying a small bag of them in his vehicle. Trucker would climb into the vehicle and find them. But first, Trucker’s nose would go quickly to my ex’s pants pockets or sweatshirt pocket where a couple of biscuits were waiting. Trucker loved the biscuits, but most importantly he loved to “perform” for my ex. He loved pleasing my ex by sitting up, giving a high five, speaking, or rolling over for a treat.</p>\n<p>That day as Trucker was lifeless on my bed, it hit me. I asked him, “Do you miss Daddy?” I always referred to my ex as “Daddy” to Trucker. I told Trucker, “I do too, but I’m sorry, he’s not coming back.”</p>\n<p>At that moment, I collapsed over Trucker <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/hugging-dogs-dog-behavior\" target=\"_blank\">and cried while holding him</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341190\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341190 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15123959/Tracy-holding-Trucker-Custom-2-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy holding Trucker (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Me holding Trucker. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>I’d been through this type of loss before. Nearly 20 years prior when I was married and my husband left me and our <a title=\"Brittany Spaniel\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Brittany\" target=\"_blank\">Brittany Spaniel</a>, Speckles. He was only supposed to be gone three weeks for work, but it grew to three months and a divorce.</p>\n<p>I remember then sitting with Speckles on a cedar chest in front of a picture window in our home. We’d sit there at night watching cars pass by. I knew Speckles was waiting for Daddy’s car to pull into the driveway. I comforted Speckles while sitting there. I became the sole pet parent to “our” dog.</p>\n<p>Now it was happening with Trucker.</p>\n<p>My ex took Trucker jogging, walking, and for rides in his vehicle to his home to play with his dogs. Now it was all gone. I had never wanted Trucker to experience abandonment again. He came into my life when he was 5 years old. He will turn 12 this year. Many people walked out of his life before he met me.</p>\n<p>As a puppy, Trucker was tossed out of a semi truck cab. Someone rescued him and then sold him at a garage sale. The couple who purchased him divorced, and Trucker moved into a new residence with the man. The man’s roommate threatened to hurt Trucker because he tore things up during bouts of separation anxiety. The man surrendered Trucker to a shelter. His ex-wife reclaimed Trucker when she spotted him at a pet adoption fair; however, she returned him to the shelter when he tore up her home due to anxiety.</p>\n<p>Trucker spent five months at the shelter before he met me. He had to be placed on two medications – Prozac and a sedative – just to help him stay calm and not injure himself trying to escape cages while workers were away.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341192\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341192 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124209/trucker-seen-in-upstairs-window-looking-out-Custom-2-600x487.jpg\" alt=\"trucker seen in upstairs window looking out (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"487\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker watching out of his favorite upstairs window. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>So many people gave up on Trucker in his life, causing him sadness and anxiety, until he met me. I had to prove to him that I would always “come back home,” and many dog-loving neighbors have chipped in to help him as comforting pet sitters.</p>\n<p>Trucker allowed my ex to enter our lives, accepting and loving him, only to be left behind.</p>\n<p>Dogs and cats mourn when a close animal pal or their owner dies. Children grieve when a parent abandons them. I’ve seen the same thing happen twice with my pets when a partner has left my life.</p>\n<p>Single parents become more sensitive to whom they let meet their children, and when. They want to protect their children from getting “too close” and facing possible heartache from abandonment again. I have seen my dog and cats mourn and will be careful to protect their gentle hearts from abandonment again.</p>\n<p>While I miss my ex’s dogs, I didn’t initiate breaking ties. I sent them toys for Christmas and think of them often. An adult can say that they no longer love and turn away from another adult, but abandoning the innocence of a pet (or a child) is something inconceivable to me.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341193\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341193 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124259/Trucker-sits-on-the-porch-roof-watching-up-the-road-Custom-600x621.jpg\" alt=\"Trucker sits on the porch roof watching up the road (Custom)\" width=\"600\" height=\"621\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker sits on the porch roof watching for cars coming up the road. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>When my first dog, Speckles, died, I held him as he took his last breath. I did not know if my ex-husband would care to know, but I called him and shared that Speckles was gone.</p>\n<p>I carry on to be a strong pet parent for Trucker, trying to fill the void my ex left in his life. I will always return home to Trucker. I will be with him and hold him until he takes his last breath.</p>\n<p>That is love.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more by </i></b><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/author/tracy-ahrens/\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Tracy Ahrens</i></b></span></a><b><i>: </i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-loves-his-feet-does-your-dog-have-a-favorite-body-part\">My Dog Loves His Feet.

So, pretty much your standard inbox fare &#8212; except Frank is a dog who purports to give out life advice to other dogs, which he communicates by tapping away on an antiquated Macintosh computer.</p>\n<p>Having sensed that this is his grand calling in life, Frank has turned himself into something of <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/askfrank\" target=\"_blank\">the Internet&#8217;s agony uncle</a>, answering emails from confused pooches around the world (and deigning himself to respond to the occasional cat).</p>\n<p>In the interests of improving the lives of both yourself and your dog, here&#8217;s a transcript of my correspondence with Frank.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342586\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342586 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074619/AskFrank2.jpg\" alt=\"AskFrank2\" width=\"600\" height=\"313\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Always take your life advice from dogs. (Photo courtesy Ask Frank)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Dogster: Why did you decide to start giving out advice to other dogs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Frank:</strong> Well, making humans smile is my mission in life. I&#8217;m good at it; like really good at it. My friends would always say, “Frank, how are you so good at making humans smile?&#8221; and “Why are you so good looking?” (Okay, they didn&#8217;t really say that last part. But I do look good.)</p>\n<p>Then I realized some of my furry friends struggled to make their humans smile. I couldn&#8217;t let that be. Inside every dog and cat is the ability to make a human happy. Sometimes, my furry friends just need a little extra help to make it happen, and I want to give them that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342587\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342587 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074740/AskFrank5.png\" alt=\"AskFrank5\" width=\"600\" height=\"607\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Can I ask what qualifies you to be giving out life advice to other dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a good question, Phil. Making humans smile isn’t just a hobby &#8212; it’s my life’s work. I own a business called From Frank that produces greeting cards and gifts all made by me and my four best furry friends &#8212; Walter, Big Louie, Lulu McFluff, and Izzy &#8212; with the sole goal of making humans smile.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also a certified therapy dog: I visit hospitals and rehab centers and participate in a children&#8217;s reading program at our local library.</p>\n<p>Throughout my work, I&#8217;ve gathered experience on just what does and doesn&#8217;t make a human smile. I&#8217;ve even written a book on the subject, <em>Don&#8217;t Fart When You Snuggle: Lessons on How to Make a Human Smile</em>, which is on sale now at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Fart-When-You-Snuggle/dp/1452141770\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. (Shameless plug, I know.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342591\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342591 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074835/AskFrank1.png\" alt=\"AskFrank1\" width=\"600\" height=\"594\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Less of the shameless plugs please, Frank. Let&#8217;s get back to the script: Can you remember the very first piece of advice you gave out?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it was accidental advice, really. You see, my good friend Big Louie farts a lot. One day he was sitting against the baseboard in our house and let one rip. As that fart bounced off the baseboard with magnificent loudness, a lightbulb came on for me: I said, &#8220;Louie, do you think you can do that again when our human gets home?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was like, &#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So we tried the technique on our human, and she laughed so hard. And that&#8217;s how I discovered that farting on baseboards makes your farts way louder and more awesome. It&#8217;s a technique Big Louie still relies on and that I still recommend to my friends today.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342592\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342592 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074857/AskFrank6.png\" alt=\"AskFrank6\" width=\"600\" height=\"571\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that qualifies as actual advice, Frank, but let&#8217;s keep this moving. What&#8217;s the weirdest situation you&#8217;ve been asked to advise on?</strong></p>\n<p>One friend asked me if it was OK to hump his sister. It’s actually a valid question since they weren’t from the same litter. But as a rule, I don’t recommend humping housemates.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep it classy, Frank. So, what sort of feedback do you usually get once you&#8217;ve given a dog some advice?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally, my advice works most of the time, every time. Sometimes results are instantaneous. And sometimes the advice takes a little longer to pan out. For example, last I knew, <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/ask-frank/2016/1/21/seats-taken-1\" target=\"_blank\">my friend Barry was still waiting for the beans to kick in</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342593\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342593 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074918/AskFrank4.png\" alt=\"AskFrank4\" width=\"600\" height=\"567\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>That just seems to be another link to you talking about farting as a solution to all of life&#8217;s little problems. Let&#8217;s switch it up. I noticed from your website you seem to use a clunky-looking, old-fashioned computer. Any plans to upgrade from the &#8217;80s anytime soon?</strong></p>\n<p>I use a Macintosh SE – MC68000 processor, 1MB of memory, 1.4MB of high-density disk capacity, and a 9-inch screen. If it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it, Phil.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a dog go about typing on a keyboard, Frank?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I YouTubed &#8220;How to type on a keyboard with paws.” Oddly, I didn&#8217;t find anything very helpful. So I just taught myself. The hardest part is when sometimes you want to type, say, “hot dog,” and it turns out as “has fog,” which doesn’t really make sense.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342596\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342596 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074952/AskFrank3.png\" alt=\"AskFrank3\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Your bio boasts that you&#8217;re &#8220;quite the ladies man.&#8221; Which celebrity dogs do you have your eye on?</strong></p>\n<p>Guilty as charged, Phil. I love all the ladies. But if you&#8217;re making me pick, I would have to say my particular favorites are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/toastmeetsworld/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Toast</a>, <a title=\"Maddie the Coonhound\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/maddie-on-things-theron-humphrey-viral-dog-photos\" target=\"_blank\">Maddie the Coonhound</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sadietripawd/\" target=\"_blank\">Sadie Tripawd</a>. The tongue, the legs. C&#8217;mon, man.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342597\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342597 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27075035/AskFrank2.png\" alt=\"AskFrank2\" width=\"600\" height=\"602\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>I suspect you might be out of your league with those classy ladies, Frank, so let&#8217;s go back to the reason why you do all this. How would you advise other dogs to go about making humans smile?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna get deep here for a minute, Phil. Come with me. So, when you make a human smile, it makes them happy. Happy humans make other humans happy. And then these other happy humans make more humans happy. It&#8217;s like a chain reaction that can spread like wildfire.</p>\n<p>You still with me, Phil?</p>\n<p>And all it takes to start the reaction is one human smile. It&#8217;s simple and small, but powerful. My advice to my fuzzy friends would be: Just have good intentions. If your goal is truly to make your human smile, and you really want that deep down in your little fuzzy heart, then no matter what technique you try, no matter if you get it right or wrong, your human will see your intentions and ultimately smile.</p>\n<p><strong>So, what makes <em>you</em> smile, Frank?</strong></p>\n<p>Has fogs. Ugh. I meant hot dogs. See?</p>\n<p>Mosey on over to <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frank&#8217;s website</a> to read up on all the life advice you could possibly want.

Before we leave the vet’s office, we have the right to ask for complete, detailed information</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342696\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342696\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27091818/shutterstock_305880713-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Veterinarian with dog by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-305880713/stock-photo-veterinarian.html?src=T_kWGXZzLYnmgT5Q2tbDMQ-1-32\">Veterinarian with dog</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The vet can provide us with her professional knowledge, consult resources available at the clinic, and also recommend sites and literature for us to review on our own. As I have personally experienced (when my pet, Brynn, was diagnosed with diabetes), we often receive just a brief (and not entirely clear) “snapshot” of the disease or condition. This may lead us to quickly accept the first response plan provided (perhaps not the most complete and optimal choice).</p>\n<p>If, instead, we remember that that we have the ability and the right to learn as much as we can about the condition, its origin, its expected progression, and what symptoms indicate a “crisis,” we will be able to move forward in a manner that better helps both us and our pet.</p>\n<h3>2. We have the right to seek a second opinion and even a specialist about our pet’s diagnosis</h3>\n<p>And while we can search for these medical professionals on our own, we can also insist that our primary vet provide us a recommendation and a referral.</p>\n<p>This right became evident to me when my first dog, Fargo, was suffering from a serious skin infection on her tail. My husband and I came home from work one evening and noticed crimson marks low on the staircase wall, as if someone had been splattering paint while crawling from the first to second floor and back. Concerned and confused, we inspected Fargo’s body and found two open lesions on her extremely long and wildly active (often responsible for knocking untethered items off low surfaces) tail. We took her to our primary veterinarian, who diagnosed a skin infection and prescribed an antibiotic.</p>\n<p>Two weeks passed with no improvement. In fact, her tail’s condition worsened. Every night, we encountered a new bloody trail on the staircase wall. We took her back to the vet and came home with a new antibiotic and a “tail wrap” strategy. But the condition continued.</p>\n<p>On our third trip to the vet, we were told that her tail’s infection was just not responding to antibiotics and then received the “not curable” diagnosis and a recommendation to schedule tail amputation surgery. At that point, I asked my veterinarian if she knew of an animal skin care specialist in town (she did) and requested a referral. The referral was made. The specialist was able to test Fargo’s tail lesions more thoroughly and discovered a “resilient” bacterium (responsive to selective antibiotics only) as the cause of the infection. After being prescribed the effective antibiotic, my Fargo was able to keep her “action” tail!</p>\n<h3>3. We have the right to research alternative or holistic treatment options to possibly add (after discussion with our vet) to the conventional treatment plan</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342698\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342698\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27092240/shutterstock_311602700-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Dog on a massage table by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-308901824/stock-photo-dog-relaxing-on-massage-table-on-light-background.html?src=cPgTrlbAIjjvdXtHxux9-Q-1-3\">Dog on a massage table</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>This may include supplements, diet changes, massage, or even a specialized holistic or integrated veterinary professional to add your pet’s treatment team. I acted on this right when my dog Dakota was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-you-need-to-know-if-your-dog-gets-diagnosed-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a>. In addition to seeing our primary vet and following her treatment plan, I took Dakota to an integrated healing clinic for their recommendation on diet alterations and supplements. With all her medical professionals informed and consenting to the overall response plan, I was able to believe that Dakota had a fully considered and well-rounded approach to combat the illness.</p>\n<h3>4. We have the right to consult our veterinarian and other professional resources on how to gauge our pet’s quality of life</h3>\n<p>What symptoms indicate a decline? And <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-pet-euthanasia-decision-death-loss-of-a-pet-goodbye\" target=\"_blank\">how can we determine our pet’s level of pain?</a> Too often, we are unsure of what to look for and do not know when our pet’s life is becoming too hard for him to bear. We can, however, educate ourselves with the help of professionals and get at least a little closer to understanding the levels of enjoyment, interest, and comfort our pet is experiencing.</p>\n<h3>5. Lastly, we have the right to feel the way we feel when our pet is diagnosed</h3>\n<p>We do not have to hide our emotions and be embarrassed by them. And if our feelings are too powerful to handle alone or with the help of friends and family, we have the right to seek professional support during our pet’s struggle. Participating in pet illness and loss support groups or seeing a counselor during this time can allow us to share feelings and gain understanding. Consulting pet grief literature and online sources may provide us with the help we need as well.</p>\n<p>My wish for all devoted pet parents throughout the lifetime of our pets is a series of easy, uneventful vet visits. But if an appointment results in a difficult diagnosis, just remember, we have the ability to claim and act upon our rights. This can allow us to move from our initial emotional place of shock and powerlessness to one of feeling ready to do all that we can — for our pets and for ourselves.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more about your dog&#8217;s health:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/ask-a-vet-can-dogs-suffer-from-glaucoma\"><b>Ask a Vet: Can Dogs Suffer From Glaucoma?</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-age-do-puppies-lose-their-teeth\"><b>What Age Do Puppies Lose Their Teeth?</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-my-dogs-gained-weight-on-a-healthy-all-natural-dog-food\"><b>Why My Dogs Gained Weight on a Healthy, All-Natural Dog Food</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Chris Corrigan Mendez, M.Ed., PLPC, NCC, is a professional counselor in private practice and the proud guardian of four rescue pooches.

Matt is a sergeant with the police department in Arlington, Texas; his job sometimes ends with people going to jail. Melanie is a social worker serving as a commander in the United States Public Health Service for the Federal Bureau of Prisons; she works in a women’s correctional institution. Every day, they both see people at their worst, but through their involvement in the <a href=\"http://www.cci.org/site/c.cdKGIRNqEmG/b.6097761/k.7684/Prison_Puppy_Raising.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Canine Companions for Independence Prison Puppy Raising program</a>, they also get to see the very best of people (and dogs) helping people.</p>\n<p>With encouragement from a community member already involved with service dog work, Melanie created a service dog puppy-raising program at the facility where she works in 2007. In 2009, they began their current partnership with <a href=\"http://www.cci.org/site/c.cdKGIRNqEmG/b.3978475/k.BED8/Home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Canine Companions for Independence</a>. Future service dogs are bred by Canine Companions in Santa Rosa, California, and puppies are flown to the Dallas/Fort Worth area at eight weeks old to begin their training at a women’s minimum-security facility. Women inmates who are approved to work with the program can have a variety of responsibilities, but each of the six puppies in a “class” has a primary caregiver who lives with the dog, as well as a backup caregiver and several volunteers.</p>\n<p>The program gives responsibility and purpose to the inmates, things that may have been lacking in some of their lives before this opportunity arose. And it seems to make a huge difference. According to Melanie, there has been a zero percent &#8212; yes, zero percent &#8212; recidivism rate amongst their <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/weekends-with-daisy-dog-book-excerpt-prison-dogs-sharron-kahn-luttrell\" target=\"_blank\">puppy-raising inmates</a>. A testament to the program, to be sure, but also to the very idea of service animals. Clearly, it is not just the eventual owners who benefit.</p>\n<p>As Melanie put it, “For many, a light is turned on in them, showing this entire other world of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dogs-on-the-inside-documentary-movie-prison-dog-training\" target=\"_blank\">volunteerism and giving to others</a>. They are proud of what they do with their time and appreciate the opportunity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342662\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342662 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085204/Hanna-Matt-Target-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Matt with Hannah, one of the puppies he and his wife have helped raise. (Photo courtesy Matt and )\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Matt with Hannah, one of the puppies he and his wife, Melanie, have helped raise. (Photo courtesy Matt and Melanie Pedersen)</p></div>\n<p>While the inmates are chiefly responsible for the care and socialization of the puppies, the program also utilizes weekend puppy raisers outside of the system to be sure the puppies are exposed to a variety of different people and situations in their formative years. After working the program from the inside since 2007, Melanie (and Matt) became weekend puppy raisers for the program in 2009. Initially, they just stepped in to help when another staff member was unable to continue with her puppy, but after the first experience, they were hooked. They have now helped raise four puppies for Canine Companions.</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie have always been “dog people.” So much so, that as a kid, Matt wanted to be a K9 handler. Between the small number of openings for those types of positions in his department and the timing of other career milestones, that opportunity never arose. So Matt was understandably pleased when they were able to participate in this program.</p>\n<p>Says Matt, “As a first responder, we are always dealing with people on the front ­end of the criminal justice process and rarely learn what happens to them if they end up incarcerated. It is heart­warming to know that programs exist at the local and federal level that not only benefit non­profit organizations and the recipients who receive service dogs, but the inmates who are involved in these programs.”</p>\n<p>I suppose now would be a good time to disclose that Matt is my cousin. And I regularly stalk their puppies on social media. I have seen adorable photos of all of their pups. Pups at the hardware store, pups at the lake, pups not eating the sushi display at the grocery store &#8212; you name it. A large part of their job is to take the pups wherever they go and to maximize exposure to the different people and scenarios they may meet later in life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342665\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342665 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085337/Hanna-Mel-firetruck-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Hanna Mel firetruck\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melanie with Hannah. (Photo courtesy Matt and Melanie Pedersen)</p></div>\n<p>But I know there is more to it than fun outings and adorable photos. For one, they need to not undo all the hard work their weekday raisers have done. Matt and Melanie are responsible for continuing the education and socialization and for teaching the puppies how to learn, so that they will be ready for their professional training at the end of the 18-month puppy raising period. And that’s the other thing. The end of the puppy-raising period comes. Every time. Ready or not.</p>\n<p>When that happens, Matt and Melanie turn the puppies &#8212; now dogs &#8212; over to Canine Companions for Independence. The dogs then go through an extensive medical workup, at the end of which, if they pass, they begin their professional training. Throughout training, Matt and Melanie receive periodic updates in the form of monthly report cards. Not all dogs go on to be matched with recipients, but if their dogs get pre-matched, they get notified, and if the dogs continue and graduate, Matt and Melanie are invited to the graduation ceremony, where they get to reconnect with their puppy and meet the recipient. When it’s their pup’s turn, they walk their dog across a stage and hand the leash to the new owner.</p>\n<p>Says Melanie, “It’s the proudest moment, and you understand the importance of your role as a puppy raiser in this process. When people ask “How can you give the dog up?” This is why. You had a job to do as a puppy raiser and now the pup has a job to do­­ help someone who needs it.”</p>\n<p>I asked both Matt and Melanie what they considered their favorite and least favorite things about puppy raising. For Melanie, it was two things. No. 1? “Good old fashioned puppy time &#8212; pure joy and love.” The other was “seeing the pup we helped raise fulfill the greater purpose as a service dog.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342667\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342667\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085441/Zack_Sedona2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Sedona, another of the puppies Matt and Melanie helped raise, went on to be the service animal for Zack Collie. (Photo courtesy Amber Collie)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sedona, another of the puppies Matt and Melanie helped raise, went on to be the service animal for Zack Collie. (Photo courtesy Amber Collie)</p></div>\n<p>Matt’s favorite thing? Aside from the puppy bonding, he says, “Talking to people in the community and getting the word out about Canine Companions when we are on puppy outings and exposure training. The dogs (and the raisers) become ambassadors for the program, so it is nice to get a chance to talk up Canine Companions and the great work they do around the country and in our South Central Region.”</p>\n<p>As for least favorite? It’s picking up poop.</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie have weekend-raised four dogs for Canine Companions. One of them, Sedona, was chosen to assist quadriplegic college student Zack Collie and one was chosen for the Canine Companions breeding program. Of the other two, one is still in advanced training and one ended up being placed as a pet. (Melanie referred to it as a “career change.”)</p>\n<p>The prison where Melanie runs the program is now raising puppies Nos. 43 to 48 since the program was established. (There have been 24 to 29 puppies for Canine Companions total, with the others with a previous partner organization.) They have learned a lot, and so I asked them what advice they would give to anyone considering doing this amazing work. Both stressed the importance of understanding the commitment. Both in terms of time and in following the rules of the program.</p>\n<p>Matt points out that as weekend raisers, they are in a unique position, but that full-time raising takes full-time commitment. He says other puppy raisers are a great resource for advice and perspective. Melanie added that the organization has staff who are there to help you be the best puppy raiser you can be.</p>\n<p>She summed it up this way: “Puppy raising is an amazing gift that you can give to someone who needs that pup. But only take on this calling if you know you can follow the rules and understand that this pup has a mission that is greater than an individual’s need for a pet dog. If someone wants another pet, then get another pet. If someone wants to make a difference in another’s life through a dog, then be a puppy raiser.”</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie inspire me. They and the dogs they are helping to raise are making a difference.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><b>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</b></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/sydney-and-sassy-get-their-puppy-nails-cut-with-the-zen-clipper\"><b>Sydney and Sassy Get Their Puppy Nails Cut With the Zen Clipper</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/10-photos-that-prove-dogs-plus-baby-goats-equals-magic\"><b>10 Photos That Prove Dogs Plus Baby Goats Equals Magic</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/coop-the-coonhound-tests-tomlyn-relax-and-calm-chews\"><b>Coop the Coonhound Tests Tomlyn Relax &amp; Calm Chews</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Lisa Seger (who goes by Blue Heron Farm on most social media platforms) is a former office drone turned dairy farmer and cheesemaker.
