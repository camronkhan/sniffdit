              "<p>It seems like Oregon is due a break from bad news. For the last month, news about Oregon was dominated by a bunch of gun-toting lunatics whose antics range from ridiculous to downright scary.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there’s more bad news, and it’s not as easy to mock as the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. <a href=\"http://www.seattledogspot.com/dog-news/oregon-pet-rental-company-euthanizes-3-adoptable-dogs/\">According to Seattle Dog Spot</a>, a Portland-based animal leasing company called <a title=\"Hannah the Pet Society\" href=\"http://www.hannahsociety.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hannah the Pet Society</a> recently euthanized three adoptable dogs for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>The three dogs &#8212; Charlie Bear, Kelso, and Pip &#8212; were put down by order of Hannah founder Dr. Scott Campbell on Nov. 24, 21015. They were scheduled to be returned to the shelters they had originally come from, but Campbell decided otherwise. In an internal email about one of the dogs, he told the staff bluntly: “Kill him.”</p>\n<p>The piece in Seattle Dog Spot is very detailed about the ages, breeds, and behavior histories of each of the three dogs. While Hannah claims that the dogs were euthanized because of “aggression,” there doesn’t seem to be any record of the kind of vicious behavior that would make that necessary. In fact, <i>Seattle Dog Spot</i> points out that in a monumental screwup, Hannah sent out emails the day after they killed the dogs offering Pip and Charlie Bear as potential adoptees. Pip was described as a “delightful charmer” suitable for children, and Charlie Bear was called a “noble confidant” who was “laid back” in temperament.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343011\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343011\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29111029/pip-euthanized-by-hannah-dog-society-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Pip, a 2-year-old Australian Terrier mix was called a &quot;Delightful Charmer&quot; by the company's public promotions.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pip, a 2-year-old <a title=\"Australian Terrier\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Australian_Terrier\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Terrier</a> mix, was called a &#8220;delightful charmer&#8221; in the company&#8217;s public promotions.</p></div>\n<p>The idea of leasing a dog or other pet is weird enough for me. It’s one of those things that my brain knows to exist, but can’t quite accept. Every time a report of one of these services crops up, I have an instinctive recoil, trying to integrate the fact that, yes, these things still happen. My main strategy for remaining sane while combing through the media comes from a line in Elvis Costello’s “(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes”: “I used to be disgusted, but now I try to be amused.”</p>\n<p>But that only goes so far. Sometimes I can only be disgusted. Looking at Seattle Dog Spot’s account of the dogs’ death builds a strong case that Hannah euthanized Charlie Bear, Kelso, and Pip for the sake of convenience rather than any intractable behavior problems.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time that animal lovers and organizations have expressed concern about Hannah the Pet Society. Criticisms of the company go back at least to 2013, when <a href=\"http://www.kptv.com/story/22063982/concerns-raised-about-pet-leasing-company-hannah-pet-society\">Portland TV station KPTV reported</a> that the Oregon Humane Society had issued a statement expressing doubts about Hannah’s ethics and the sources of its animals. It read in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We support out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to saving lives, and this is certainly the case with a company that occasionally sources animals from shelters and leases them to caretakers &#8230; We are concerned about the source of animals when not coming from shelters. Hannah society has not shared with us any criteria that would preclude the lease of puppy mill source dogs &#8230; for the people who read the fine print and are looking for a less committed relationship, this might be the right choice. Whether it&#8217;s the right choice for pets remains to be seen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the same report, one of Hannah’s customers, Diane Tate, said that the company’s contract was so ambiguous that she didn’t realize she wouldn’t actually own the dog. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t really clear initially that you were renting the dog,” she told KPTV. “(It wasn&#8217;t clear) that all the decisions would be made by Hannah the Pet Society. You would be consulted, but other than that, everything is their decision.” When she tried to back out of the contract, Tate said that the company began pressuring her so hard to stay in the agreement that it felt like harassment.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343010\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343010\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29111028/kelso-euthanized-by-hannah-dog-society-600x686.jpg\" alt=\"Kelso was an 11-month-old Lab mix, whose assessment said, &quot;Is ok with other dogs/Is friendly to new people/High energy/Very loving and playful&quot;\" width=\"600\" height=\"686\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kelso was an 11-month-old <a title=\"Lab\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Lab</a> mix whose assessment said, &#8220;Is ok with other dogs/Is friendly to new people/High energy/Very loving and playful.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pawsanimalshelter.org/\">PAWS shelter in West Linn, Oregon</a>, also said that when it offered a kitten to the company, it refused. A volunteer at PAWS told KPTV, &#8220;They advertise that they work with shelters and get their animals from shelters and rescues, when in fact they only take again the highly adoptable, easily sold, pretty animals.”</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1lWI032oe4?rel=0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/12/08/couple-take-pet-leasing-store-to-court.htm\">Hannah was also sued by two clients, Sandee and Walter Strunk</a>, in December 2014. The Strunks alleged that Hannah was using its leasing model to get around normal licensing requirements and used a number of pressure tactics to lock them into an agreement in which the company holds all the cards. According to the lawsuit, the company demanded a $600 fee for the couple to cancel the agreement. According to Courtroom News:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The cancellation fee is intended as a punitive forfeiture penalty to discourage consumers from ever terminating their monthly payment obligations to defendant,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Strunks claim Hannah&#8217;s leases pets because it knows people are unlikely to return an animal they have grown to love &#8220;if they cannot be sure that the pet will not be euthanized by defendant, which exercises sole discretion to make life-ending decisions as the owner of the pet.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter how you slice it, one thing seems clear: Something is rotten at Hannah the Pet Society. Until now, complaints around Hannah have mainly been focused on financial profiteering on people’s love for their pets; now there are at least three bodies to be accounted for.</p>\n<p>To be fair, the rot probably isn’t in Hannah specifically but in the entire model of leasing pets. Reporting on the Strunk lawsuit in 2014, <a href=\"http://www.seattledogspot.com/dog-adoption-rescue/oregon-couple-sues-pet-leasing-company/\">Seattle Pet Spot<i> </i>made some excellent points</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I should say here that I don’t like the idea of renting pets.<strong> It reinforces the concept that pets are expendable,</strong> which is how so many dogs end up in shelters.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You dog peed on your carpet or barks too much? Just return it to the shelter. Getting a new puppy? Make room for it by turning your older dog over to a shelter. Moving to a new city and can’t take your dog? Just leave it in your yard for someone else to deal with.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Another reason I don’t like the rent-a-pet model is that it is focused on making as much money as possible, and since Hannah is the legal owner of the pets it leases, it may make decisions about a pet’s health based on its bottom line instead of what’s in the best interest of the pet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, pet leasing comes with many of the same problems of buying from a pet store, plus a few more. Hannah claims that most of its dogs come from shelters and rescue organizations, but by last November, the only organization that was contracted to give them animals was the <a title=\"Columbia Humane Society\" href=\"http://columbiahumane.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia Humane Society</a> in Saint Helens, Oregon. After the three dogs were euthanized, Columbia naturally severed the relationship.</p>\n<p>So now where is Hannah getting its dogs? That’s a murky and important question for any ethical pet owner.</p>\n<p>But at least when you take a dog home from the pet store, you know that even if he had a traumatic history at some hellish puppy farm, you can provide him with a healthy and happy future. When you lease a pet from Hannah or a similar service, they control all the decisions about the dog’s health. For life.</p>\n<p>Whatever the facts behind the death of these three dogs, one thing seems clear: Pet leasing is bad for both humans and animals, and Hannah seems to be especially bad.</p>\n<p>Tell us your take on renting pets in the comments.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more commentary from Chris Hall:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/petas-war-on-pit-bulls-is-not-ethical-or-good-for-animals\"><b>PETA’s War on Pit Bulls Is Not Ethical or Good for Animals</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/commentary-stop-debating-whether-homeless-people-should-have-pets\"><b>Commentary: Stop Debating Whether Homeless People Should Have Pets</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/would-you-clone-your-dog-for-100000-should-you-clone-your-dog\"><b>Would You Clone Your Dog for $100,000?

Unlike my smaller dog, Marshmallow, he doesn’t need a parka &#8212; but I sure do.</p>\n<p>I’m in full winter gear when we head out into the freezing temps, and that includes a pair of thick mittens. I prefer mittens to gloves because my fingers get to hang out together and keep each other warm. Unfortunately, the thumb on my leash hand ends up too far from the group and gets painfully cold. That’s why I was excited to try the <a title=\"Winter Leash\" href=\"http://winterleash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Leash</a>, a new product that bills itself as the only leash that keeps your hand warm.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342424\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342424\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114322/HM-and-GB-winter-leash-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"Don't let the open coat fool you -- it's cold up here!

Don&#8217;t let the open coat fool you &#8212; it&#8217;s cold up here! (Photo courtesy Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>The folks at Winter Leash sent me two versions of the product to test out: the <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/full-winter-leash/product.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Winter Leash</a> and the <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/index.php?option=com_hikashop&amp;view=product&amp;layout=show&amp;Itemid=460\" target=\"_blank\">Swivel Shackle</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Full Winter Leash is essentially a leash with a built-in mitten, ideal for walking one dog and perfect for my nighttime strolls with GhostBuster. It’s not always just me and my boy, though. We also walk with Marshmallow during the warmer parts of the day, and that’s when the Swivel Shackle comes in handy. Unlike the Full Winter Leash, there is no lead attached to this mitten. Instead, the shackle allows the walker to attach multiple leashes or a coupler (great for walking GhostBuster and Marshy simultaneously). Both versions of the mitten are thumbless, so your whole hand stays together inside the mitt for maximum warmth. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342422\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342422\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114319/winter-leashes-600x349.jpg\" alt=\"The Swivel Shackle and the Full Winter leash -- similar but different.

(Photo by Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>Inside the mittens are <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two handles to control the leash or shackle. There’s a small loop and a big loop, so you have a few options for getting a good grip. I like to use both handles for maximum control (especially handy when my Marshmallow spots one of the many wild neighborhood rabbits or that sassy <a title=\"Beagle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagle</a> she hates so much). The Full Winter Leash also has an extra handle at the top of the leash so you can control your dog with two hands if need be (again, super handy in rabbit emergencies).</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342423\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342423\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26114320/Marshy-GB-Winter-leash-coupler-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"My inappropriately attired husband using the Swivel Shackle while out with GhostBuster and Marshmallow (Photo by Heather Marcoux)\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My inappropriately attired husband using the Swivel Shackle while out with GhostBuster and Marshmallow. (Photo by Heather Marcoux)</p></div>\n<p>Both Winter Leashes (as well as <a href=\"http://winterleash.com/carabiner/product.html\" target=\"_blank\">another option with a carabiner</a>) are made in the USA, and both have a cool utility pocket on the outside, which was perfect for carrying my keys and a few poop bags. The two mitts I tried were made of different materials. The Full Winter Leash mitten is comprised of a blue, limited-edition fabric known as</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polartec PowerShield, while the black </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swivel Shackle mitten uses </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polartec’s Windbloc material. The blue leash is a little softer inside, but both kept my hand nice and toasty while braving the winter weather with GhostBuster.</span></p>\n<p>I really liked walking with the Winter Leash because my thumb was no longer lonely and able to keep warm with the rest of my fingers, but it did put me at a disadvantage when it came to picking up poop. When I wear my regular mitts, I don’t have to expose my hand at all if I’m using a large bag with handles, and only have to expose my hand briefly if using the small poop bags that come in a roll. Because the Winter Leash mitts are thumbless, I have to take my hand out in order to peel open a bag, pick up a poop, and tie the bag shut. I’m trying to train myself to use my non-leash hand for poop grabbing, but getting a bag open and tying it requires thumbs.</p>\n<h3>Dogster scorecard for the Winter Leash</h3>\n<p><b>Quality: </b>A+. The fabrics are great, as is the hardware. The trigger-style snap on the end of the Full Winter Leash isn’t something I’m used to, but works well. The webbing for the full leash is great quality and sourced from a manufacturer on Rhode Island.</p>\n<p><b>Style:</b> I’m way more concerned with function than style when it comes to walking during the winter. That being said, these aren’t ugly. Certainly no worse than most heavy-duty mitts.</p>\n<p><b>Function:</b> My hands stayed warm and I still had great control &#8212; even with two dogs.</p>\n<p><b>Creativity:</b> The guy behind Winter Leash, Mike, is a former Army Ranger who used his experience with military textiles in developing the product. The Winter Leash is unlike anything I’ve seen at my local pet stores.</p>\n<p><b>Value: </b>At $49.99 &#8211; $54.99, the Winter Leash isn’t inexpensive, but the high-quality materials of this American-made product mean you can expect to be using this thing for multiple seasons. The Full Winter Leash won’t set you back much more than a quality leash and a pair of thermal mittens would.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-health-tips-how-to-winterize-your-dog-winter-cold-weather\" target=\"_blank\">If you live in a cold climate</a> and suffer from frozen thumbs, the Winter Leash is a good buy. Before using this product, the thumb on my leash hand would always be freezing cold long before the rest of me. Cold hands can mean shorter walks, something that’s fine by Marshmallow but not cool with GhostBuster. Inside the Winter Leash, my thumb stays warm and my leash hand is actually warmer than my other hand now.</p>\n<p>Who’s got two warm thumbs now and can stay outside just as long as GhostBuster? This lady!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more Dogster Reviews:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-6-dogs-try-out-the-piddle-place-potty-system\"><b>My 6 Dogs Try Out the Piddle Place Potty System</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-attempts-at-keeping-my-dog-safe\"><b>It Has Taken Me Years to Find the Safest Collar, Harness, and Leash for My Dog</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/the-active-pack-tests-kurgos-car-safety-products-for-dogs-and-drivers\"><b>The Active Pack Tests Kurgo’s Car Safety Products for Dogs and Drivers</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><i>About the Author:</i></b><i> Heather Marcoux is a freelance writer in Alberta, Canada.

After her 11 puppies were born, she was dumped at <a title=\"Milton Animal League\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/miltonanimalleague/?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Animal League</a> with the reason of suspected <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/mange-in-dogs-causes-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">mange</a>. With red skin and missing much of her fur, Blueberry was in a miserable state. With proper veterinary care, she was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-allergies-hives-itching-blood-skin-test-food-elimination-diet\" target=\"_blank\">allergies</a>, and treatment began to clear her skin. Maura Porter, a volunteer at the shelter, had recently lost her dog to leukemia and fell in love with Blueberry.</p>\n<p>Maura had also lost a friend, Gerry, to cancer. Her friend had never liked animals, but after a dog visited him during hospice care, he began to soften his stance. To honor Gerry&#8217;s memory, Maura wanted to do therapy dog work, as well as help change people&#8217;s minds about <a title=\"Pit Bull\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier\" target=\"_blank\">Pit Bull</a>-type dogs.</p>\n<p>However, Blueberry&#8217;s future as a therapy dog was uncertain because of her past confinement; her only interaction with other dogs was when she was being bred. They began training for the AKC Canine Good Citizen test anyway, and Maura found that her doubts were completely unfounded. Blueberry succeeded in every area. In fact, she was the first dog in her group to pass the challenging CGC test.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342054\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342054\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23122624/IMG_0015-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry at graduation from therapy dog school.

Therapy Dogs of Massachusetts</a> with flying colors, Blueberry and Maura were finally ready to begin their work. Maura describes Blueberry as a natural. &#8220;She is caring and loving and has great compassion. She brings more joy to people that I could ever have imagined.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Blueberry has been doing therapy dog work for almost three years now, visiting nursing homes, rehab hospitals, and colleges during exam times. They also have assigned hospice patients for weekly visits and have visited with blind and deaf residents of the New England Homes for the Deaf. &#8220;What is amazing to see is that her breed does not matter to the people with whom she visits,&#8221; Maura says. &#8220;All they see is her love. And that to me is perfect beyond words.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342056\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342056\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23122626/IMG_077811-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry doesn't let her past hold her back.

(Photo by Maura Porter)</p></div>\n<p>Early into Blueberry&#8217;s therapy dog career, she was called upon for a big job &#8212; to help comfort those affected by the Boston Marathon bombing. Dog B.O.N.E.S. Therapy Dogs of Massachusetts was asked to send teams down to the site of the bombing after Boylston Street was reopened to businesses.</p>\n<p>Those businesses had requested teams because many of their employees were afraid to return to work after witnessing the tragedy. Blueberry went to the bombing site for three weeks. &#8220;People whispered in her ear, others told her how saddened they were,&#8221; Maura recalls. &#8220;It was amazing to see them open up to a dog. It was like it was OK to open up to her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once Boylston Street had been completely reopened to the public, Blueberry and Maura visited Copley Square, where a makeshift memorial had started to form. People were drawn to Blueberry, as well as the other therapy dog teams. &#8220;One woman, a trauma nurse, told me that she had not wanted to come back down, but that once she spent time with Blueberry she was so glad she had faced her fears,&#8221; Maura says. &#8220;At one point, as I sat on the ground with Blueberry, watching her interact with the person she was with, I looked up and saw people waiting &#8212; 15 people deep &#8212; just to be with her, in that place, at that time. To this day, it amazes me how powerful her presence and the other therapy dogs&#8217; presences were felt.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342058\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342058\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23123844/IMG_1099-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry is a hit with the babies, too!

(Photo courtesy Maura Porter)</p></div>\n<p>Maura and Blueberry&#8217;s journey as a therapy dog team has not been without its hindrances. Until the visit at the site of the Boston Marathon bombing, Maura had not taken Blueberry to Boston for visits due to a law that required dogs like her to be muzzled in public. Thankfully, that law has since changed, but other areas still have similar restrictions.</p>\n<p>Maura&#8217;s closest friend lives in Denver, but she cannot visit her and take Blueberry because <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breeds-pit-bulls-bsl-mutts\" target=\"_blank\">Pit Bulls are banned there</a>. Within the therapy dog world, Maura and Blueberry have been turned away from facilities once they learn Blueberry&#8217;s breed. &#8220;I always say if I can get them to meet her, she will win them over,&#8221; Maura says. While it has been difficult at times to get those initial meetings, everyone who has met Blueberry is left with a positive and lasting impression.</p>\n<p>Now 7 years old, Blueberry continues to change minds, one visit at a time. To follow her adventures as a therapy dog, like her on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Blueberry-the-Pit-Bull-Therapy-Dog-Changing-Minds-One-Visit-at-a-Time-218206764888576/?fref=ts\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/houstons-friends-for-life-helps-a-stray-dog-named-mother-mary-give-birth-on-christmas-day\"><b>Houston’s Friends for Life Helps a Stray Dog Named Mother Mary Give Birth on Christmas Day</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-two-amazing-weekend-puppy-raisers-for-a-prison-training-program\"><b>Meet Two Amazing Weekend Puppy Raisers for a Prison Training Program</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\"><b>Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About Meghan Lodge:</strong></em><em> Fits the Aquarius definition to a fault, loves animals, and is always pushing for change.

              "<p class=\"p1\">On Dec. 30, some boneheads went to the San Bernardino Animal County Shelter, a high-kill facility, to pick up their dogs &#8212; Cookie, 15-year-old <a title=\"Cocker Spaniel\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Cocker_Spaniel\" target=\"_blank\">Cocker Spaniel</a>, and a 1-year-old <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a> &#8212; who had been brought in as strays.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All well and good, right? Two family dogs got loose, they were picked up as strays, the owners were notified, and they went to pick up their dogs. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s supposed to work, right?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Only, it didn&#8217;t work out that way. It nearly did, but our boneheads saw their chance to be mammoth idiots, and they did that job spectacularly. They only picked up one dog. The younger dog.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They left their senior dog behind &#8212; in a high-kill shelter.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Cookie is crying for her family. She watched as the family drove away and left her to die,&#8221; said a member of the San Bernardino City Shelter, according to a story in <a href=\"http://blog.fido4ever.com/15-year-old-senior-pup-cries-as-owner-leaves-her-behind-walks-out-with-younger-pup/\" target=\"_blank\">Fido4Ever</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343399\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094535/cookie-11-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"cookie-11\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fortunately, heartless and cruel acts tend to get noticed by people who work at shelters, and the story quickly spread through social media. Soon, she was sprung by <a title=\"OC Small Paws (So UT)\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws (So UT)</a> and placed in a foster home. Fortunately, the bonehead owners had at least surrendered the dog, which allowed her to go to a new home rather than sit through the seven-day stray hold.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What&#8217;s even more shocking about this story is that Cookie appears to have been mistreated as well. She had multiple tumors, her hair was matted, and she smelled &#8220;like trash,&#8221; according to a OC Small Paws Facebook post, leading staff to assume she was &#8220;an outside dog.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It appeared her abandonment had been happening for a while, as she&#8217;d seemingly been tossed in the backyard, ignored.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343398\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094505/bonehead-cookie-1-600x338.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343396\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094502/bonehead-cookie-2-600x360.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-2\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The group arranged for the Cookie to get much-needed medical attention, and multiple tumors were removed, including one the size of a softball. She&#8217;s now doing fine in her foster home, where she&#8217;s going to live out the rest of her days.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws</a> Facebook post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">We have made the collective decision to not adopt her out. She will stay under the care of the rescue for the rest of her life in a local forever foster. She also will be under the care of our vet who has already done her first surgery. &#8230; We appreciate the outpouring of help on her. At this point she is covered. Please if you are able consider helping a local dog that may not be as lucky as Cookie to have an army of people looking out for her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">Check out more photos of Cookie enjoying life with her foster parent:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343394\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094500/bonehead-cookie-4-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-4\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343393\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094458/bonehead-cookie-5-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-5\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343395\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02094501/bonehead-cookie-3-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"bonehead-cookie-3\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Photos via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OC-Small-Paws-So-UT-669232903193731/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">OC Small Paws (So UT) Faceook</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Read about more boneheads:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/this-bonehead-stole-a-yorkshire-terrier-puppy-and-traded-her-for-crack\"><b>This Bonehead Stole a Yorkshire Terrier Puppy and Traded Her for Crack</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/this-bonehead-drove-a-car-through-an-animal-clinic\"><b>This Bonehead Drove a Car Through an Animal Clinic</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/bonehead-handler-dumps-his-retired-police-dog-in-a-kill-shelter\"><b>Bonehead Handler Dumps His Retired Police Dog in a Kill Shelter</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/boneheads-leave-their-senior-dog-in-a-high-kill-shelter-only-take-home-their-younger-dog\">Boneheads Leave Their Senior Dog in a High-Kill Shelter, Only Take Home Their Younger Dog</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com\">Dogster</a>.</p>\n"

(Photo by DCL/Keith Barraclough)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Brooklyn:</strong> I&#8217;d pretend I didn&#8217;t hear that question, but we all know no one would believe me! It&#8217;s true, my ears are comically large, but that&#8217;s just part of being a 13-week-old <a title=\"German Shepherd\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\" target=\"_blank\">German Shepherd</a>.</p>\n<p>Look, here&#8217;s the deal. We&#8217;re puppies, we don&#8217;t wear helmets &#8212; you&#8217;re gonna hear the crowd noise. But I&#8217;m a German Shepherd. I&#8217;m a working dog. I&#8217;m one of the smartest canines on the field, if not the planet. And when I retire from the Puppy Bowl, I&#8217;ll probably end up being a freakin&#8217; cop.</p>\n<p>So, will I hear the noise? Yes. Will it ruin my focus? Not a chance. My ancestors came to this country without so much as a collar around their neck. I&#8217;m bringing the trophy back to Germany, where the Puppy Bowl probably makes more sense than actual American football. By the way, I&#8217;d like to take this forum to thank my foster parents for undermining my heritage by naming me after the fourth most populous city in America. That was sarcasm, in case your normal-sized ears couldn&#8217;t pick up the frequency.</p>\n<p>But seriously, no &#8212; no concerns over the crowd noise. The referee&#8217;s whistle? Well, that&#8217;s a whole &#8216;nother story.</p>\n<p><strong>Dogster: </strong>Down in the front for Andy Cohen: You&#8217;re tiny, and you&#8217;re named after a Bravo TV host &#8212; How do you plan on intimidating Team Fluff?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343366\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-343366 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02083845/andy-cohen-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Cohen. \" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andy Cohen.

This game is all about leverage. And chew toys, it&#8217;s definitely about chew toys.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get this out in the open: Yes, I&#8217;m pretty. Yes, my profuse coat needs to be thoroughly combed at least twice per week. You know who else requires a lot of grooming? Tom Brady &#8212; ever heard of him? That guy&#8217;s got four Super Bowl tags around his finger collars.</p>\n<p>I hear the whispers. Team Fluff is calling me a &#8220;lap dog.&#8221; You know what? I AM a lap dog &#8212; I&#8217;m gonna run laps around them at Puppy Bowl XII.</p>\n<p><strong>Dogster:</strong> Coop: You&#8217;re one of the big boys in the big game &#8212; How do you plan to dominate the competition?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343368\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343368\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02084328/cooper-600x900.jpg\" alt=\"Cooper.

Bella, at 20 weeks, you&#8217;re one of the oldest dogs in the game &#8212; How are you feeling, and will this be your final game?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343374\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343374\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02084754/bella-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Bella.

It&#8217;s very confusing, especially for me, since I have such a tiny head. My brain can&#8217;t be that big, it just can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>You know, at 20 weeks, you don&#8217;t run like you&#8217;re 15 weeks anymore &#8212; that&#8217;s a veterinary fact. But it&#8217;s not all bad. I have more life experience than any of the other puppies in this game. Football is a fall sport, and I was pretty much the only dog here even alive in the fall. I was getting house trained when these guys were still gestating.</p>\n<p>They say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t teach an old dog new tricks.&#8221; Well, I&#8217;m gonna teach these young ones a thing or two, I promise you that.</p>\n<p>As for if this will be my last game or not &#8212; look, I don&#8217;t worry about the chatter.

Humans crave variety and new taste sensations. From alchemists fruitlessly seeking the elixir vitae to caffeinated drinks, juice cleanses, and craft beer, we have always wanted more from the liquids we consume. Are any of the water alternatives we enjoy safe to share with our dogs?</p>\n<p>What can dogs drink? Dogs are curious, easily bored creatures, whose experience of the world depends in great measure on their mouths and <a title=\"what can dogs drink\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-do-dogs-lick-people\" target=\"_blank\">tongues</a>. They are also opportunistic omnivores, meaning they&#8217;ll happily ingest &#8212; eat or drink &#8212; anything we put in front of them or leave within their reach. Dogs can drink anything, but should they? Let&#8217;s examine some of the most frequently asked questions about dogs and fluids!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink milk?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink alcohol?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink coffee or tea?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can dogs drink fruit juice?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>How long can a dog go without water?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_342282\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342282\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102347/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-01-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There&#8217;s no substitute for a <a title=\"how much water should a dog drink\" href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/dog-tibetan-terrier-pathetic-water-700227/\" target=\"_blank\">dog drinking water</a>. (Photo via Pixabay)</p></div>\n<h2>Can dogs drink milk?</h2>\n<p>During the first five or six weeks of life, you can reliably find a baby puppy locked onto one of mother&#8217;s teats. Dog milk provides not only essential nutrition to puppies, but also passes along useful antibodies. Once a puppy is weaned, though, and ready to move on solid food, his need for milk and ability to process it diminishes accordingly. Dogs can and will drink milk if it&#8217;s available, but once they reach maturity, adult dogs are largely <a title=\"can dogs drink milk\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-eat-cheese-eggs-ice-cream-drink-milk-dog-health-food\" target=\"_blank\">lactose intolerant</a>. The calcium and protein that dogs derive from milk is capably provided by a quality dog food.</p>\n<p>Does lactose intolerance mean that <a title=\"are dogs lactose intolerant\" href=\"http://www.pfiaa.com.au/Feeding-Pets/Feeding-Milk-to-Pets-and-Lactose-Intolerance.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">dogs cannot drink milk</a> at all? No. For dogs, just as for humans, being lactose intolerant involves not producing sufficient lactase to break down dairy products in large quantities. All milk is not the same, so a dog&#8217;s reaction to cow&#8217;s milk will differ from that of his mother. The worst that the typical dog can expect from drinking more milk than his digestive system can process is temporary digestive upset. A bit of milk on occasion can be a nice treat, but shouldn&#8217;t be depended on as any kind of alternative to water.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink alcohol?</h2>\n<p>Can <a title=\"can dogs get drunk\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-drink-beer-wine-alcohol-ethanol-hops-grapes-poisoning-toxicity\" target=\"_blank\">dogs drink wine</a>, beer, or any other kind of alcoholic beverage? These kinds of questions are asked especially around festive occasions, such as holidays and major sporting events, when dog owners tend to enjoy a tipple. In the vast majority of situations, they are asked out of a kind of heedless curiosity. Some people might find it amusing to see their dog act drunkenly, but there is nothing funny about testing a dog&#8217;s tolerance or subjecting them to alcohol poisoning.</p>\n<p><a title=\"is beer bad for dogs\" href=\"http://www.vetstreet.com/dr-marty-becker/is-it-safe-to-give-a-dog-beer\" target=\"_blank\">Dogs can get drunk</a>, and suffer much more debilitating effects from a fraction of the alcohol consumption than the average adult human. Ethanol toxicosis can cause not only motor function impairment, but also lead to problems with heart and lung function. Some of the primary ingredients in wine and beer &#8212; grapes and hops &#8212; are each potentially toxic to dogs in their own right. Alcohol of any variety, whether in the form of wine, beer, or distilled spirits, offers our dogs nothing but deadly danger.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink coffee or tea?</h2>\n<p>As much as I may enjoy a beer after work, when I&#8217;m at work, a mug of coffee is never far from my lips. Are caffeinated beverages, like <a title=\"can dogs drink coffee\" href=\"http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/poison/caffeine/\" target=\"_blank\">coffee or tea</a>, safe to share with dogs? The simple answer is no. Caffeine poisoning poses health risks just as great to dogs as alcohol. Because dogs typically have much less body weight than humans, it takes far less caffeine to negatively impact a dog&#8217;s body, much like with alcohol.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342283\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342283\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102350/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-02-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a title=\"lactose intolerance in dogs\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/_tar0_/5031998865\" target=\"_blank\">Should dogs drink milk</a>? No. (Photo by Taro the Shiba Inu on Flickr)</p></div>\n<p>Found in everything from coffee, tea, and soda to energy drinks, chocolate candy, and nutritional supplements, caffeine is also more readily available and more likely to be accidentally ingested than alcohol. If your dog likes to root around in the same garbage can where you toss your coffee grounds, even these can threaten her health. Where fermented drinks depress a dog&#8217;s vital systems, caffeinated foods and beverages accelerate them beyond acceptable levels. High blood pressure, increased heart rate, and hyperactivity are only a few consequences of <a title=\"can dogs drink soda\" href=\"http://www.banfield.com/pet-health-resources/preventive-care/nutrition/caffeine-is-toxic-to-your-pets\" target=\"_blank\">caffeine toxicity</a> in dogs.</p>\n<h2>Can dogs drink juice?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s understandable that a dog&#8217;s digestive system is not physically capable of processing lactose, alcohol, and caffeine in the same ways as a human&#8217;s. What about nominally healthier drinks? Surely fruit juices must be safe for dogs to drink? Not so fast! In limited quantities or as an occasional treat, de-seeded <a title=\"can dogs drink orange juice\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/can-dogs-eat-fruit-and-grapes-raisins-dog-health\" target=\"_blank\">apples and oranges</a> are neither toxic or unhealthy for dogs. Store-bought juices or fruit juices from concentrate are another matter.</p>\n<p>If you are making the juice yourself from <a title=\"can dogs drink apple juice\" href=\"http://www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/pmahaney/2013/oct/which-fall-fruits-are-healthiest-for-pets-30994\" target=\"_blank\">fresh fruits</a>, a small bit of these juices should not contain enough natural sugars to upset your dog&#8217;s stomach. The sugars, preservatives, and other chemical additives in even the healthiest fruit juices at the grocery store may put a strain on your dog&#8217;s digestion. If you&#8217;re inclined to offer your dog apple or orange juice, start with a small amount to gauge your dog&#8217;s reaction.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342284\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342284\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25102353/what-type-of-water-alternatives-can-dogs-have-03-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"what type of water alternatives can dogs have\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dogs should not drink <a title=\"what can dogs drink besides water\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-187655531/stock-photo-miniature-dachshund-and-coffee-cup.html\" target=\"_blank\">coffee, tea, or soda</a>. (Photo via Shutterstock)</p></div>\n<h2>Dehydration in dogs can be a serious problem</h2>\n<p>The truth is, once weaned from mother&#8217;s milk, the only beverage a strong and healthy dog needs to stay that way is a steady supply of <a title=\"dehydration in dogs\" href=\"http://www.petmd.com/dog/nutrition/evr_dg_the_importance_of_water#\" target=\"_blank\">clean, fresh water</a>. While humans derive health, energy, or joy from a variety of fluids, food should provide all the nutrients and energy a dog needs. Dogs don&#8217;t get or require the same kinds of carnal pleasures that we do from milk, coffee, soda, or fruit juices. There is no substitute or alternative drink that does as much for the average dog as water.</p>\n<p>Dehydration can cause just as many problems for dogs as drinking the wrong kinds of beverages. Water contributes substantively to every part of a dog&#8217;s physical life. From the circulatory system to joint mobility and flexibility, and from temperature regulation to energy level, water is essential to your dog&#8217;s health. Keeping your dog properly hydrated means providing them water and keeping their water dishes clean.</p>\n<p>Fresh water is even more important during periods of extreme weather. Be particularly vigilant about your dog&#8217;s water supply during the summer and winter. Since dogs have limited ability to <a title=\"do dogs sweat\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/do-dogs-sweat-dog-panting-glands-health-facts\" target=\"_blank\">sweat</a> and panting uses up a great deal of internal moisture, they should have constant access to water to help them regulate their body heat. In the dead of winter, it&#8217;s just as important to make sure your dog&#8217;s water bowl isn&#8217;t freezing over.</p>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong> Melvin Peña trained as a scholar and teacher of 18th-century British literature before turning his research and writing skills to puppies and kittens.

              "<p>Horses are said to grow long in the tooth as they age. I sometimes quip that dogs do the opposite. As they chew and play with balls (especially abrasive tennis balls) and toys, their teeth wear down. Elderly dogs often grow short in the tooth.</p>\n<p>My very good pal Buster is growing metaphorically short in the tooth. He is now 10 and a half years old. His overall health is very good. He is happy and trim, and he looks younger than many dogs who are only 6 or 7. But age is taking its toll on my pal in one way: He has arthritis.</p>\n<p>For several years, Buster has limped on his left front leg after heavy exercise. X-rays show that he has arthritis in his elbow. He also has significant evidence of degenerative joint disease (which is the formal term used for canine arthritis) in several other joints. He is a <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a> mix. Let&#8217;s face it: Arthritis is almost ubiquitous in old Labs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_334838\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-334838 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16102449/barchas-thumb-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"barchas-thumb\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Eric Barchas and Buster. (Photo by Liz Acosta)</p></div>\n<p>For the last year, I have given Metacam to Buster on heavy activity days. Metacam, also known as meloxicam, is a member of a class of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. It has worked wonders for my pal. He is much more active and comfortable after exercise when he takes the drug.</p>\n<p>Most dogs who take Metacam experience no side effects, and Buster certainly has not shown any clinical evidence of adverse effects. However, Metacam, like all NSAIDs, has the potential to cause upset stomach or, rarely, severe gastrointestinal problems. It also, like almost all drugs, is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys; it can damage them in the process, and the kidneys are especially susceptible. I run blood tests on Buster regularly, and so far there has been no evidence of organ damage. However, I worry about the potential for the medicine to stress his organs &#8212; especially his kidneys &#8212; in the long run.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow the advice that I have always dispensed to clients whose dogs require NSAIDs to enjoy a good quality of life. I use the minimum effective dose. Buster only gets the medicine on days when I think he&#8217;ll be in pain without it. And I use a dose that is lower than the one that is generally recommended.</p>\n<p>However, I wanted to do more to help Buster enjoy a good quality of life and to minimize the use of NSAIDs. I have always provided adequate exercise (to promote strength) and have kept Buster&#8217;s weight at an ideal level (to reduce strain on the joints). About six months ago, I also began to treat Buster with a product called Adequan.</p>\n<p>Adequan is an injectable product containing polysulfated glycosaminoglycans. It is, essentially, injectable glucosamine. It is widely available through veterinarians, who usually can arrange to administer the injections.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343130\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343130\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01083123/shutterstock_329068601-600x240.jpg\" alt=\"Glucosamine by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-329068601/stock-photo-glucosamine-is-an-amino-sugar-and-a-prominent-precursor-in-the-biochemical-synthesis-of.html?src=Ooyycsdk4gCYJCiCp0IjBw-1-3\">Glucosamine</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The so-called induction period for Adequan consists of twice weekly injections for up to four weeks. The medication usually is then used (off-label) every two to four weeks for maintenance therapy.</p>\n<p>I bought a couple of bottles of Adequan and administered Buster&#8217;s induction doses. The difference was remarkable. Buster needed far less Metacam on his heavy activity days. His quality of life also improved in subtle but appreciable ways. He had more of a spring in his step. He was more frisky. He was quicker to greet me at the door. He smiled more. Seriously. Adequan made him a happier dog. His life was much improved.</p>\n<p>Buster received maintenance injections first every two weeks, then every three. I finally reduced his frequency to once a month. Buster&#8217;s most recent dose was due last Monday.</p>\n<p>As I prepared to administer the injection, I second guessed the dose. It had been a month since I last administered the drug. I was 99 percent certain that the dose was 4.4 mg/kg, but 99 percent isn&#8217;t the same as 100 percent. It was time for a quick consultation with Dr. Google. The good doctor promptly directed me to the <a href=\"http://www.drugs.com/vet/adequan-canine.html\" target=\"_blank\">drugs.com monograph</a> for the product. The dose was, indeed, 4.4 mg/kg (2 mg/lb).</p>\n<p>I care a lot about my pal&#8217;s health, so I figured that I might as well check out the product&#8217;s safety profile while I had the monograph at the ready. And that&#8217;s when I became pissed off.</p>\n<p>The monograph described a so-called subacute toxicity study. Thirty-four <a title=\"Beagles\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagles</a> were divided into groups and were administered doses of the product at approximately one, three, and 10 times what is recommended for a period of 13 weeks (which is more than three times the recommended duration of induction treatment). And then:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Necropsies were performed 24 hours after the final treatment. During week 12, one dog in the 50 mg/kg dosage group developed a large hematoma at the injection site which necessitated euthanasia. No other mortalities occurred during the treatment period.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Necropsy is how veterinarians say autopsy. In other words, the study was a terminal one. The Beagles were euthanized at the end of the study so that they could be dissected and studied.</p>\n<p>Where should I begin? First, let&#8217;s get the results of the study out of the way. They showed a number of minor changes and irregularities that almost certainly are nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about why I got mad. How about the Beagle whose hematoma &#8220;necessitated euthanasia&#8221;? I don&#8217;t buy it. Hematomas are swollen areas under the skin filled with blood. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of hematomas, and I can&#8217;t remember one that necessitated euthanasia. If Buster developed a hematoma as a result of an injection, I&#8217;d explore the myriad treatment options &#8212; ranging from intermittent drainage to pressure and warm compresses to indwelling drain placement to en bloc surgical resection &#8212; that are available. The Beagle&#8217;s hematoma most likely did not <em>necessitate</em> euthanasia &#8212; rather, the researchers <em>elected</em> to euthanize rather than treat, probably (in my speculative opinion) because the dog was going to be euthanized soon anyway.</p>\n<p>And how about the fact that all of the dogs in the study were members of one breed? <a title=\"Beagles traditionally are the standard breed used for research in dogs\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/beagle-freedom-project-lab-animal-testing\" target=\"_blank\">Beagles traditionally are the standard breed used for research in dogs</a>. Beagles are dogs, and my dog is a dog, but my dog is not a Beagle. Might the drug affect Lab-mutts differently?</p>\n<p>And now for the real meat of the matter: Why was the study a terminal one? I don&#8217;t know with certainty, but I have a pretty strong hunch.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_343128\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-343128\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/01082651/shutterstock_304277162-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Beagle in a cage by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-304277162/stock-photo-dog-behind-the-cage.html?src=9GzYcaPCBV8fUPuZQmA6Qw-1-13\">Beagle in a cage</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The best study would have followed hundreds or thousands of dogs over many years. They would have been monitored clinically, and blood and urine parameters would have been measured regularly. They would have died of other causes, and their lifespans and autopsy results would have been compared statistically.</p>\n<p>That study would have cost a lot of money. And it would have delayed the release of the product by many years. The Beagle study only lasted 13 weeks, and evidently was sufficient for FDA approval. I&#8217;ll allow you to draw your own conclusions.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for my pal Buster, Adequan has been on the market for many years. Many, many thousands of dogs have taken the product, and no serious complications have been discovered. The best study, in effect, has been run through the use of the product. Adequan appears safe.</p>\n<p>However, I must admit to a feeling of moral conflict. Adequan has helped Buster immensely, but if I continue to use it I will be supporting the corporation that ran the terminal Beagle study. Should I continue to use it? Fortunately, my pal&#8217;s next dose is not due for thee weeks, so I have some time to mull it over.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hear from you, readers? Would you knowingly give your dog a medicine tested in this way?

Is he a multidisciplinary genius whose only flaw is to be misunderstood by a cruel and hyper-snarky public? Or is he an attention-craving chancer who&#8217;s lucked his way into the big time?</p>\n<p>Actually, it turns out the real James Franco is none of the above &#8212; at least if a revelatory <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juicyjamesfranco/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram account</a> is to be believed. Instead, James Franco is actually a terrier mutt who&#8217;s been happily living his life in San Francisco. Allow me to explain.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s in a name?</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342452\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342452 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26120715/JamesFrancoBurger.png\" alt=\"JamesFrancoBurger\" width=\"600\" height=\"550\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juicyjamesfranco/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p>James &#8220;Juicy&#8221; Franco is the canine behind a burgeoning Instagram account that chronicles his adventures in the Bay Area. The precise reasons behind the pup&#8217;s honorific are never really explained &#8212; but the photostream gives off a vibe that&#8217;s something of a tongue-in-cheek homage to the altogether less fluffier Franco.</p>\n<h3>Philosophy, you know it&#8217;s he</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342451\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342451 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26120556/JamesFranco2.png\" alt=\"JamesFranco2\" width=\"600\" height=\"498\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juicyjamesfranco/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p>In common with his thespian namesake, our pooch is fond of relaying his deepest thoughts and worldly ponderings in an altogether philosophical manner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are we human or are we Franco?&#8221; asks his Instagram bio, while elsewhere he can be heard pontificating, &#8220;Fall is to leaves as acting is to applause.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most insightful of all is the caption to the above photo: &#8220;Ice, ice baby.&#8221;</p>\n<p>True knowledge of self is a powerful and dangerous thing.</p>\n<h3>A beautiful mind</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342450\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342450 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26120504/JamesFranco1.png\" alt=\"JamesFranco1\" width=\"600\" height=\"523\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juicyjamesfranco/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p>As you&#8217;d expect from such a philosophical pooch, James Franco can often be found in serious contemplation.

I passed on that invite more often than not.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t actually played a game with other adults until recently, when <a title=\"Earth Rated\" href=\"http://www.earthrated.com/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Earth Rated</a> sent me its limited-edition Cards Against Caninity. The unofficial expansion pack for <a title=\"Cards Against Humanity\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CardsAgainstHumanity/\" target=\"_blank\">Cards Against Humanity</a> not only puts a canine spin on the wildly popular game, but it helps keep shelter dogs warm!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343146\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01092843/Combo_NiceThings-600x306.jpg\" alt=\"Combo_NiceThings\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343147\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01092844/2016-01-30-REMINDER-Combo_Dreaming-600x306.jpg\" alt=\"2016-01-30-REMINDER-Combo_Dreaming\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /></p>\n<p>For a chance to win the game, simply nominate a U.S. or Canadian shelter to receive a case of Earth Rated fleece blankets. The company will give away 1,000 packs and 50 cases of blankets.</p>\n<p>So, is Cards Against Caninty as fun as its inspiration? Which involves one player picking a question card and the others picking the answer he or she might like best? It is! I invited over my game-loving neighbors Dennis, Kate, and Bubba the <a title=\"Pug\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Pug\" target=\"_blank\">Pug</a> for a round.

This article appeared in our February/March issue. </i><a href=\"https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/B6/DFY/DogsterHomeCtrl033015b.jsp?cds_page_id=183914&amp;cds_mag_code=DFY&amp;id=1437762384091&amp;lsid=52051326240037584&amp;vid=1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Subscribe to Dogster</i></span></a><i> and get the bimonthly magazine delivered to your home.</i></p>\n<p>Let’s face it: As much as we love our dogs, pets can be expensive. Saving money sometimes feels impossible, but it can be done. To help give us all a jumpstart, I reached out to budget experts who spend their entire careers gathering tips on the best way to stretch a dollar. I asked each of them for one of their favorite ways to save on pet expenses. They didn’t disappoint!</p>\n<h3>Use discount gift cards and loyalty programs</h3>\n<p>Andrea Woroch is a nationally recognized consumer and money-savings expert for Kinoli Inc., not to mention a loving dog mom. When Andrea shops for her <a title=\"Goldendoodle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/goldendoodle\" target=\"_blank\">Goldendoodle</a>, Bauer, she doubles up whenever possible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341524\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341524\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144529/dog-money-roll-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"(Image courtesy OTA Photos/Flickr\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dog with dollars by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/101332430@N03/21225816748/\">OTA Photos/Flickr</a>.</p></div>\n<p>First, she hits discount gift card sites like <a href=\"http://GiftCardGranny.com\" target=\"_blank\">Gift Card Granny</a>, where you can purchase gift cards to pet-supply stores for up to 30 percent off. No one said gift cards can’t be gifts to yourself!</p>\n<p>Gift Card Granny pulls together a number of card exchange sites allowing you to compare shop on gift cards. These exchange sites purchase unwanted gift cards from consumers and then turn around and sell them to you. The percentage you can get off a card varies, so using Gift Card Granny helps you find the best deal out there.</p>\n<p>The next step is to sign up for loyalty programs at pet-supply stores you frequent. My keychain has so many mini loyalty cards attached to it that I have to double check with the checkout person where I am, so I can hand over the correct one!</p>\n<p>Loyalty programs work differently for each store but almost always guarantee you weekly in-store deals. In addition, many loyalty programs reward you with additional savings the more you spend. Petco’s <a href=\"http://www.petco.com/pals-rewards\" target=\"_blank\">Pals Rewards</a>, for example, gives you five reward dollars for each $100 you spend.</p>\n<h3>Buy prescriptions online</h3>\n<p>Regina Conway, consumer expert for <a href=\"http://Slickdeals.net\" target=\"_blank\">Slickdeals.net</a> and the proud pet parent to her adorable mixed-breed dog, Cricket, shared one of my favorite tips: Don’t purchase prescriptions from your vet. Of course, if your dog needs medication immediately, don’t hesitate to turn to your vet’s office. But ask if you can get a prescription, especially for ongoing medications, including flea and heartworm medication, and other high-cost drugs.</p>\n<p>Shop around for a better price with one of the many online veterinary pharmacies, such as <a href=\"http://www.1800petmeds.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1-800-PetMeds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drsfostersmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drs. Foster &amp; Smith</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.petrescuerx.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pet Rescue Rx</a>, which donates 100 percent of its net profits to rescues and shelters of the customer’s choice.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341526\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341526\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144532/dog-shopping-cart-600x452.jpg\" alt=\"Dog with shopping cart by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-244349002.html&amp;src=download_history\">Dog with shopping cart</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>I once had to take a dog in my care to the vet to remove part of a tick that I had failed to fully get out. As a precaution, he put her on medication for <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/lyme-disease-in-dogs-dog-health-tips-symptoms-treatment-ticks-borrelia-burgdorferi\" target=\"_blank\">Lyme disease.</a> The vet didn’t stock it, so he sent me to my pharmacy to get it filled. When I received the quote from the pharmacy, I almost passed out. I purchased just enough to last me until I could have the medicine delivered by an online source. The savings were enormous!</p>\n<p>On the flip side, sometimes certain drugs cost less when purchased from a human pharmacy compared to buying them from your vet or even a vet pharmacy. Do your research before buying.</p>\n<h3>Compare before you buy</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kimberly-palmer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Palmer</a>, author of <em>The Economy of You</em> (AMACOM, 2014), brought this tip — probably taught to you by your frugal grandfather — to the Internet age. Comparing before making online purchases is key. It’s something, admittedly, I don’t do enough of. But the cost of a product can vary considerably depending on who is selling it.</p>\n<p>This principle applies to in-store purchases, too. The same can of dog food will have a different price at your grocery store, big box store like Target or Walmart, or pet-supply store. Regina advised checking prices online before purchasing in store. Pet supplies are often less expensive when purchased online (don’t forget to note the cost of shipping).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341527\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341527\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/19144534/puppy-dollars-600x473.jpg\" alt=\"Puppy surrounded by money by Shutterstock\" width=\"600\" height=\"473\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-116787223.html&amp;src=download_history\">Puppy surrounded by money</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>For even more online savings, search for coupon codes (digital coupons redeemable at checkout) on websites like <a href=\"http://www.retailmenot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RetailMeNot</a>. Kimberly suggested looking at the app <a href=\"http://redlaser.com/application/\" target=\"_blank\">RedLaser</a> to compare online prices and <a href=\"http://www.getinvisiblehand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">InvisibleHand</a>, a browser add-on that helps ensure you’re getting the lowest online prices available. Excuse me while I go download Invisible Hand right now!</p>\n<h3>More easy tips</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up for emails from your favorite retailers so you can stay up to date on their sales.</li>\n<li>Clip coupons from the Sunday paper. You can also print coupons from your computer (check out <a href=\"http://thekrazycouponlady.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Krazy Coupon Lady</a> for a searchable database of printable coupons).</li>\n<li>Buy dog food in bulk. Try splitting the cost/amount with neighbors or friends.</li>\n<li>Learn to groom your dog yourself. One trip to the groomer can be the same cost as purchasing the tools you need to do the job yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>Read related stories on Dogster:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-care-how-to-save-money-expenses-food-grooming-vets-tips\"><b>How to Save Money on Dog Expenses</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/6-ways-how-to-save-money-pet-dog-expenses\"><b>6 Ways to Save Money on Pet Expenses</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/10-tips-for-saving-money-on-pet-expenses\"><b>10 Tips for Saving Money on Pet Expenses </b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author: </i></b><a href=\"http://wendyandriggins.com/\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Wendy Newell</i></span></a><i> is a former VP of Sales turned Grade A Dog Sitter.

              "<p>I came home one night to find my laundry hamper on its side in the kitchen. It made some sense, as my washing machine in my old apartment was located in a closet at the end of the small, galley-style kitchen. But I had left the hamper in the dining area. I thought it was odd, picked it up, and went on my way.</p>\n<p>I should have known better. I have a <a title=\"Beagle\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Beagle\" target=\"_blank\">Beagle</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342729\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342729\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27105853/lulu-begging-600x398.jpeg\" alt=\"My Beagle, Lulu. (Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My Beagle, Lulu. (Photo by Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>A week later, I found an empty lamb-lung treat bag hidden behind the couch. It hadn’t been ripped apart, but expertly opened and emptied.</p>\n<p>Lightbulb! The laundry hamper. I’d had an opened lamb-lung treat bag on a counter in the kitchen. But I kept it in the back, away from prying noses and teeth and paws. Or so I thought. Lulu must have used the hamper to get to the bag.</p>\n<p>My Beagle, for her part, regarded me with a tail wag and a head tilt. How could I get mad? At this point, she wouldn’t even know why I was upset. And she looked too darn cute.</p>\n<p>If you have a dog, chances are good you can sympathize. Maybe you have a similar story. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breeds-beagle-beguiling-buddy-super-sniffer\" target=\"_blank\">But if you own a Beagle</a>, it’s almost a certainty you know what I deal with.</p>\n<p>Beagles are often falsely depicted as being unintelligent. This is patently false. Beagles are brilliant. They’re just stubborn. And when it comes to food, they are evil geniuses. Doggy supervillains.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342732\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342732 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110444/lulu-lamb-lung-bag-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulo loves lamb lung. (Photo by Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>While I try to be two steps ahead of Lulu at all times, I have often been bamboozled by my Beagle, in particular for food.</p>\n<p>For example, while living in the same apartment, I would keep Lulu’s Heartgard pills on the high breakfast nook. Sure, it was in plain sight, but I’d kept it there for months and Lulu never showed any interest, and she couldn’t reach anyway.</p>\n<p>One night, I came home from work to find a brand-new pack on the floor. I had just bought the six-pack and given her one chewable. The other five pills were now missing. The package was not mangled, either. Each pill pocket was opened as if I’d done it myself. All gone. Happy, tail-wagging Lulu. Panicking me.</p>\n<p>The Heartgard site had no info on whether Lulu was in any danger. Nothing on the poison control website I checked. So I called the emergency vet, who promptly laughed. “Honey, she can eat more than one package and nothing will happen.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, eating six pills in one day won’t provide you with six months of heartworm protection. Back to the vet for another pack.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we moved to a house. Lulu could go out and run around in the backyard. The trouble was getting her to come back in. Now, Lulu has a fairly good recall. But suddenly she was refusing to come inside.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342734\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342734\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110614/lulu-silly-600x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Lulu loves her backyard. (Photo by Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulu loves being outside. (Photo by Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>If I were coming home at a reasonable hour, I would just let her stay out there. But I come home late at night. Eventually I’d like to go to bed. So I started offering a treat to bring her in.</p>\n<p>Now she would rather stay outside all day and night than come in without getting a treat. Sometimes she’ll even refuse to come in if the treat bribe isn’t to her liking.</p>\n<p>Lulu is also good at catching me when my guard is down.</p>\n<p>One day, I was washing my other dog, Jasmine, a chore that involves high-value treats to coax her into the bathroom. The kind of treats that gets Lulu’s <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-facts-sense-of-smell\" target=\"_blank\">super-powered sniffer going. </a>(Beagles have around 225 million scent receptors. Few dog breeds have better noses.)</p>\n<p>When the bath was over, Jasmine flew past me and my towel. I rushed out to grab her before she began dousing the couch with eau du wet dog.</p>\n<p>While I wrestled with the zooming mutt, I heard a rustling. I’d left the bag of treats on top of the toilet. By the time I got back to the bathroom, they were gone, along with Lulu.</p>\n<p>Another time was really dumb on my part and could have been quite dangerous. Parties can be the worst when you have a dog. I had some friends and family over for my birthday. The dogs seemed more interested in meeting all the newcomers than what we were grilling, and at one point no one was minding the food table. So Lulu helped herself to some chicken breast. Thank goodness there were no bones. Needless to say, Lulu spent the rest of the day inside.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342730\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342730\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27110057/lulu-after-chicken-600x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Lulu loved the chicken. (Photo courtesy Christie Zizo)\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lulu loves chicken. (Photo courtesy Christie Zizo)</p></div>\n<p>Lulu’s greatest scheme, however, is the one everyone else falls for. Those big, sad eyes. To the Beagle novice, they are irresistible. Who can say no to a begging Beagle? Certainly not my Dad, and boy Lulu knows it. He was watching her while I was away at a conference once, and I came home to find him absentmindedly feeding her Cheetos.</p>\n<p>“Don’t feed her that!” I yelled. “But she likes them!” he exclaimed. Oy.</p>\n<p>It’s not just my father who falls under Lulu’s spell.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a year, Lulu may attend four or five pet-related events – fairs, conferences, expos. Lots of vendors with samples for dogs.

For Nana, their meeting marked the first time a human made her feel safe.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We got into the car, and she just laid her head on my lap for the two-hour drive home, and ever since that moment we have been inseparable.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This love story began a few months after Doris started volunteering with <a title=\"ROMP Rescue\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ROMPRescue\" target=\"_blank\">ROMP Rescue</a> and following rescue pages on Facebook. That’s when a photo of Nana appeared in her feed and changed her life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She just looked so sad and &#8212; I hate to say this word &#8212; really truly pathetic. Her eyes were so hopeless.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342893\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342893\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28141247/Inake-nana-600x451.jpg\" alt=\"Having this intake picture posted to Facebook likley saved Nana's life. (Photo courtesy the Friends of North Central Shelter - Los Angeles Animal Services Facebook page)\" width=\"600\" height=\"451\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Having this intake picture posted to Facebook likely saved Nana&#8217;s life. (Photo courtesy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/northcentralshelter/photos/a.424345857645851.100443.151616524918787/423903234356780/?type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">the Friends of North Central Shelter &#8211; Los Angeles Animal Services Facebook page</a>)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nana had every reason to feel hopeless. She was around 8 years old when she was surrendered to a Los Angeles city shelter. Thin and dirty with nipples hanging down to her knees, veterinarians who examined Nana estimated that she’d had between 12 and 15 litters before being dropped off. Her ears were terribly infected and disfigured, likely the result of an at-home ear cropping. Her teeth were nothing but nubs, having been filed down either by human hands or her own actions as she chewed a chain or metal crate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It’s hard to imagine a dog who someone had for eight years could be in that condition,” says Doris. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a senior Pit with medical needs, Nana wasn’t exactly the most adoptable dog in the shelter. Being kept in medical isolation made her chances even worse &#8212; she wasn’t visible to visitors. Facebook was Nana’s only chance to get noticed and get out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a rescue volunteer, Doris was used to having her social media feeds dominated by photos of dogs in need and had learned not to react emotionally to every picture posted. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“You just can’t bring home every single dog,” she explains. At the time, Doris was a graduate student living at home with her parents and her first rescue dog, a young <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\" target=\"_blank\">German Shepard</a> mix named Zyra. She says she was in no position to adopt another dog, so she didn’t usually let her heart take over when shelter dogs stared back at her from the screen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There was just something about Nana that broke through that wall,” she explains.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342894\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342894\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28141701/nana-doris-zyra-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Nana got her happy ending with Doris and Zyra.

(Photo courtesy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Journeyofnana/timeline\" target=\"_blank\">Nana the Earless Pibble</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Doris immediately offered to foster Nana, knowing her euthanization date had come and gone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“She was already kind of living on borrowed time,” she says. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if the threat of euthanization hadn’t loomed over her, Nana wouldn’t have lasted long without serious medical help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Her ears were so cauliflowered, and they were literally covered in brown ooze. It was all infection and bacteria, and they smelled awful,” Nana’s human recalls. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fostering a sick, sad Pit Bull with a sketchy past didn’t sound like a great idea to Doris’ parents at first, but they soon followed in the daughter’s footsteps and fell in love with Nana. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For the first two months, we just focused on her health; she wasn’t really adoptable,” says Doris, who had her hands full with Nana’s medical issues.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342895\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342895 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28142042/nana-ears-600x433.jpg\" alt=\"Nana's ears were causing her serious pain. \" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nana&#8217;s ears were causing her serious pain. (Photo courtesy Nana the Earless Pibble)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the infection in her ears, Nana also has issues with her skin and fungus on her paws. Over time, Nana developed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drug-resistant bacterial infections &#8212; MRSA and Pseudomonas &#8212; in her ears. She was in constant pain, and it was clear the ears were not salvageable. Eventually she had two surgeries, a bilateral total ear canal ablation and a bulla osteotomy, during which two pounds of scar tissue and inflammation were removed from her ears. The surgeries left Nana deaf, but she was happier than Doris had ever seen her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When she was no longer in pain, she just totally blossomed,” says Doris, who remembers seeing Nana play with toys and vocalize for the first time after her surgeries. “Even to this day, she continues to blossom.”</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342899\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342899 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28143240/nana-grass-600x459.jpg\" alt=\"nana grass\" width=\"600\" height=\"459\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Three years after being saved from the shelter, Nana is loving life. (Photo courtesy Nana the Earless Pibble)</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No longer in pain, Nana started learning how to be a dog. Taking cues from then-2-year-old Zyra, Nana grew more confident and playful with each passing day. Although she’d initially been fearful of men, she developed a strong bond with Doris’ father. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“My dad just fell absolutely head over heels for Nana. I credit him with pushing me to keep her.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months after springing Nana from the shelter, Doris was regularly taking her foster dog to adoption events, but her dad was starting to think the adorable senior Pit should stay put. According to Doris, Nana had just been diagnosed with dermal hemangiosarcoma, an aggressive skin cancer, and her father didn’t want the dog bouncing around from home to home. Still, Doris and Nana continued to attend adoption events. People frequently asked about Nana’s story and (to Doris’ dismay) if she had puppies available, but no potential adopters came forward. Then, one day, an adopter finally expressed interest in Nana, and Doris realized that her father was right &#8212; this dog had already found her forever human.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Doris by her side, Nana fought her cancer and completed chemotherapy. With Nana by her side, Doris moved to Nevada for medical school. Together, the pair have become well-known advocates for Pit Bulls. In 2014, Doris (who had never heard of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/6-ways-you-can-fight-breed-specific-legislation-in-your-community\" target=\"_blank\">breed specific legislation</a> or the staggering Pit Bull euthanization statistics before meeting Nana) spoke in front of a crowd at the <a href=\"http://www.standupforpits.us/one-million-pibble-march-on-washington-dc/\" target=\"_blank\">One Million Pibble March</a> in Washington.  </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342896\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342896\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28142457/nana-dc-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Nana advocating in D.C.

When they called us and asked us to help, of course we said yes.”</p>\n<p>Being a resource for the community and providing care to homeless animals are a part of the mission of Friends for Life. It was founded in 2002 by executive director Salise Shuttlesworth and is a no-kill alternative to traditionally run shelter facilities in the area.</p>\n<p>Lawson said Mother Mary came under the care of Friends for Life just before Christmas. Because of her obvious advanced pregnancy, volunteers worked to make sure she was comfortable and not placed around the other dogs. “When dogs are pregnant, they like their space,” Lawson said. So, a warm space was created just for her in the shower area of the facility’s wellness department.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341261\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341261 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17101122/600x457-600x457.jpg\" alt=\"Friends for Life stepped in to help Mother Mary, a stray dog, who was being fed by neighbors and about ready to give birth.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Calling it nothing short of a Christmas miracle, Lawson explained, “Mother Mary actually started giving birth on Christmas. She delivered 12 puppies, and it was ongoing and all day. Certain members of our staff and volunteers were actually there to witness some of the births because it lasted a while and she gave birth to so many.”</p>\n<p>The litter consisted of eight female and four male puppies. A popular Christmas song provided the inspiration for the they names: Turtledove, Drummer, Piper, Leaper, Dancer, Milky, Swan, Goose, Ringer, Birdy, Henna, and Partridge.</p>\n<p>Lawson said that, unfortunately, one of the puppies didn’t survive. “We lost Turtledove.”</p>\n<p>Currently, Mother Mary and her puppies are being fostered offsite by a Friends for Life staff member. Lawson said that the foster mother is equipped to take care of the babies and makes sure they are all getting adequate nutrition as they continue to grow and start to open their eyes. “It&#8217;s nice to have them in a safe home where they are not overwhelmed with all of the other activity at the shelter,” she added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341262\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341262 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17101159/600x337-600x337.jpg\" alt=\"Not long after she was brought under the care of Friends for Life, Mother Mary began to give birth to 12 puppies on Christmas Day.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Since the rescue is located at 107 E. 22nd Street in Houston, Lawson said, “This was our own little miracle on 22nd Street. It was too perfect, especially when she started to give birth on Christmas morning.”</p>\n<p>In addition to helping Mother Mary and her litter, Friends for Life is striving to advance its mission by continuing to reach out to the community and helping other animals in need.</p>\n<p>Shuttlesworth said that last year, the rescue gave away more than two tons of food through its food bank. Friends for Life also underwrote more than 1,300 free surgeries for animals of residents in underserved neighborhoods, which prevented more than 26,000 animal births, she said.</p>\n<p>When Friends for Life came into existence, she explained, “It offered a progressive choice to Houstonians who believe we can do better. We have proven that those ‘unadoptable��� animals are, in fact, adoptable, and that 75 percent of the animals we have placed in loving homes would not have made it to the adoption room floor at traditional shelters.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342906\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342906\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/28150114/ffl-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"Friends For Life Houston is the also the only LEED-certified no-kill animal shelter in Texas.

(Photo courtesy Friends for Life)</p></div>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, Shuttlesworth said, “We intend to continue to expand the mentorships and partnerships in the community. We look forward to opening a veterinary clinic on the property we have purchased adjacent to our current facility, which will serve greater Houston.”</p>\n<p>She added that by providing accessibly priced veterinary medical services, more people will be able to take better care of their animals and won&#8217;t have to take an animal to a shelter in the first place. Or have their dog end up on the streets, pregnant and looking for a safe place to have their puppies.</p>\n<p>Check out Friends for Life on <a title=\"Friends for Life\" href=\"http://www.adoptfriends4life.org/\" target=\"_blank\">its website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FriendsForLifeHouston/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adoptfriends4life/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram.</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/meet-two-amazing-weekend-puppy-raisers-for-a-prison-training-program\"><b>Meet Two Amazing Weekend Puppy Raisers for a Prison Training Program</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/atlantas-w-underdogs-helps-disadvantaged-kids-and-dogs-alike\"><b>Atlanta’s W-Underdogs Helps Disadvantaged Kids and Dogs Alike</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/collide-nyc-helps-homeless-youth-care-for-their-pets\"><b>Collide NYC Helps Homeless Youth Care for Their Pets</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>About the author</em></strong><em>: Anne Forline is a freelance writer in Bellmawr, New Jersey.

We pretty much need an indoor potty system for our little dogs who don&#8217;t like to go outside when it&#8217;s cold and wet, which in Seattle can be much of the year.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340279\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340279\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10144134/May-Belle-in-Blanket-600x583.jpg\" alt=\"May Belle prefers to stay inside where it's warm and cozy when the weather is cold and grey.

(Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>Typically, we use potty pads placed on the wood floor behind our couch, and this works well enough for us. However, we were recently given the <a href=\"http://www.piddleplace.com/piddleplace/\" target=\"_blank\">Piddle Place Pet Relief System</a> to try.</p>\n<p>The system is a sturdy, rectangular plastic contraption that is more or less a litter box for dogs. It is almost flat, with an artificial grass mat placed on top. To eliminate odors, there is a bio-enzyme liquid that you mix with water and place inside the base, and you can replace the solution every week to keep things fresh.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340281\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340281\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10144639/Piddle-Place-inspected-by-Ezio-600x620.jpg\" alt=\"Our cat, Ezio, was quite curious about the Piddle Place Pet Relief System. Photo by Kezia Willingham.\" width=\"600\" height=\"620\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our cat, Ezio, was quite curious about the Piddle Place Pet Relief System. (Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>It took my dogs about a week or so before they actually used the Piddle Place to relieve themselves, so at first I wasn&#8217;t sure that it would be successful in my household. As things tend to go, right about the time I was going to give up, I witnessed Ruby, our 4-pound <a title=\"Chihuahua\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Chihuahua\" target=\"_blank\">Chihuahua</a>, waddle over and pee right on top of it. Victory!</p>\n<p>I am not sure if Ruby finally just got used to it or if it was because I placed a potty pad on top, but once she started peeing on it, she continued to do so, and our other dogs followed suit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342717\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342717\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27103909/IMG_1597-600x751.jpg\" alt=\"Go Ruby! (Photo by Kezia Willingham)\" width=\"600\" height=\"751\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Go, Ruby! (Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>Compared to potty pads, I would say the advantage of the Piddle Place Pet Relief System is that it is more environmentally friendly and less expensive over time than potty pads. It is small enough to fit nicely inside most apartments, townhouses, and condos. If you live in a building that requires you to use several flights of stairs or an elevator to get outside, a Piddle Place inside your home is a good option.</p>\n<h3>Dogster Scorecard for Piddle Place Pet Relief System</h3>\n<p><strong>Quality:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System appears well made and sturdy. The one thing that bothered me a little was that the artificial turf slides off the base pretty easily and slips onto the floor. Also, one of my cats or dogs (not sure who) chewed some of it, and I worry a little about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Style:</strong> It does not take up too much room. I am fairly certain no one would find it amazingly good-looking, but it&#8217;s not horrendous, either.</p>\n<p><strong>Function:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System is definitely functional. I had to place a potty pad on top to get my dogs started, but I think it is a useful tool, especially if you are just getting ready to adopt a small dog and <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/house-training-a-puppy-tips-tricks-advice-dog-behavior\" target=\"_blank\">plan to train her from the start </a>to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>Creativity:</strong> Whoever came up with this idea certainly had a creative approach in thinking of a reusable, environmentally conscious indoor potty-system for pets.</p>\n<p><strong>Value:</strong> The Piddle Place Pet Relief System can be ordered online through a variety of different companies, including <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Piddle-Place-Relief-System-Removable/dp/B007AJZ46Y\">Amazon</a>. It is about $100, which is reasonable, considering that it is reusable and can last for years.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340287\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340287\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10145911/Ruby-600x716.jpg\" alt=\"Ruby was the first of our dogs to try Piddle Place. Photo by Kezia Willingham.\" width=\"600\" height=\"716\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ruby was the first of our dogs to try the Piddle Place. (Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>As pet owner, I think it is good to have as many tools on hand as possible in order to provide your pets with opportunities to be successful, whether you are assisting them with bathroom, food, or medical needs. The Piddle Place Pet Relief System is a great choice for environmentally conscious, small-dog pet parents. The system may not work as well for larger dogs.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about the Piddle Place Pet Relief System on the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.piddleplace.com/piddleplace/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Read more Dogster Reviews:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/the-active-pack-tests-kurgos-car-safety-products-for-dogs-and-drivers\"><b>The Active Pack Tests Kurgo’s Car Safety Products for Dogs and Drivers</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/riggins-and-friends-review-the-adventure-dog-heeler-first-aid-kit\"><b>Riggins and Friends Review the Adventure Dog Heeler First Aid Kit</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/sydney-and-sassy-get-their-puppy-nails-cut-with-the-zen-clipper\"><b>Sydney and Sassy Get Their Puppy Nails Cut With the Zen Clipper</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About Kezia Willingham:</strong> Also known as the Breadwinning Laundry Queen, Kezia lives in Seattle with her family, which includes a pack of rescued cats and dogs.

              "<p>Like the song says, breaking up is hard to do, but as earth-shattering as it can be for the humans involved, it is just as hard for the family dog. His pack is forever changed. It&#8217;s important to do what you can during this life transition to help your dog feel safe, loved, and secure.</p>\n<p>My dog, Riggins, wasn&#8217;t always &#8220;my&#8221; dog. He was &#8220;our&#8221; dog. The &#8220;our&#8221; in the equation was my boyfriend and myself. We lived together in an apartment in Los Angeles. Although our separation was due to a number of things, Riggins was indeed one of them. My boyfriend wasn&#8217;t happy when I had to travel for work and he was obligated to come home and walk the dog. Obviously not someone I could stay with!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341452\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341452 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232337/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_4-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"helping your dog through a breakup_4\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins as a puppy. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>The breakup was hard on Riggins. Truthfully, at the time, I didn&#8217;t take Riggins&#8217; feelings into account. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-my-dog-has-pulled-me-through-dark-periods-in-my-life\" target=\"_blank\">I leaned on him emotionally</a>, and he was always there for me, but I didn&#8217;t take any steps to help him in the transition.</p>\n<p>Even now, eight-plus years later, I think that fact that Riggins is drawn to men at the dog park, where he <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dogs-need-for-stranger-love\" target=\"_blank\">forces them to give him love and attention</a>, is because of his daddy-abandonment issues.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341453\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341453\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232632/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_5-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins saddles up to a stranger during a hike.

(Photo by Wendy Newell.)</p></div>\n<p>What should I have done to help Riggins out during this difficult time in our lives?</p>\n<p>I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KristinvonKreislerAuthor\" target=\"_blank\">Kristin von Kreisler</a> to get some suggestions. Kreisler is an author of the upcoming novel <em><a href=\"http://kristinvonkreisler.com/books/earnest/\" target=\"_blank\">Earnest</a></em>. The title character, a loyal <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a>, who Kreisler describes as &#8220;eager to please,&#8221; &#8220;sweet,&#8221; &#8220;wonderful,&#8221; and &#8220;devoted,&#8221; goes through a breakup with his human parents. In preparation for the novel, which was inspired by the real life story of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/fighting-for-your-dog-in-a-divorce\" target=\"_blank\">Stanley and Linda Perkins of San Diego, who spent more than $100,000 in a custody battle over their Greyhound mix</a>, Kreisler interviewed vets, people who had lived through a breakup where a pet was involved, and even Maggie, a neighborhood yellow Labrador Retriever who Earnest gets many of his personality traits from.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341448\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341448\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18231315/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_1-600x803.jpg\" alt=\"Kreisler and Maggie. (Courtesy of Kristin von Kreisler.)\" width=\"600\" height=\"803\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kristin von Kreisler and Maggie. (Photo courtesy Kristin von Kreisler)</p></div>\n<p>Kreisler explains, &#8220;They [animals] lose their sense of safety and security when their family is broken. It&#8217;s really, really hard.&#8221; Her mission with her novel<em> Earnest</em> is to help readers &#8220;grow in their understanding and sensitivity of what dogs go through when their worlds fall apart.&#8221; Through her research, Kreisler has come up with suggestions on how to help your dog through a breakup.</p>\n<h3>1. Don&#8217;t fight in front of the dog</h3>\n<p>Keisler explains, &#8220;Dogs are so sensitive, and they read our feelings even better than we do, I think.&#8221; She explains that this attunement is when animals not only read feelings but take it a step further and get in tune and in sync with what you are feeling. Empathy in its purest form.</p>\n<p>If you are arguing or becoming aggregated, put the dog in the other room, go outside, or leave the house completely.</p>\n<p>I know from personal experience that Riggins responds to my emotions, and, at least once, <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/have-you-ever-lost-it-at-the-vets-office-when-your-dog-was-sick\" target=\"_blank\">my anxiety has meant a trip to the vet</a> when he fed off what I was feeling.</p>\n<h3>2. Alter your dog&#8217;s routine as little as possible</h3>\n<p>The more you can keep your dog&#8217;s life the same, the easier it will be for him to get used to his new life. Keisler suggests making changes slowly. If moving, take your dog to the new place a few times prior, making it a fun and happy experience for him. Put moving materials like boxes out for a while before packing so they aren&#8217;t seen as something negative. If possible, take your dog to a stable environment he is used to throughout the change in housing. For example, a dog park or doggie daycare.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341451\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341451 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18232203/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_3-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"helping your dog through a breakup_3\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins and me during a past move. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<h3>3. Arrange for visits</h3>\n<p>Visits with your ex can help your dog know he has not been abandoned. Make it extra special when your ex leaves and give your dog a treat. The person&#8217;s exit will become a time to celebrate and eat tasty things!</p>\n<p>Although Riggins loves anything food-related and would, no doubt, be up for goodbye treats, there was no way I was going to let my ex near me, him, or our new place. Keisler wouldn&#8217;t be happy with me saying this. She would, no doubt, tell me to put aside my own anger and bitterness and do what is best for Riggins. Luckily, my ex didn&#8217;t want to have visitation, so it was a moot point!</p>\n<h3>4. If sharing custody, minimize the confusion and uncertainty</h3>\n<p>Keep a united front in front of the children! Agree on some rules beforehand: When the dog is fed and bathed, whether he can sleep in the human bed, what kind of dog food he eats, and whether he is allowed human food. Make sure to go through each of these things and come to an agreement you can both stick to.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341454\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341454\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18233448/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_6-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins enjoys a special treat (frozen chicken broth)celebrating his first birthday in his own backyard. (Photo by Wendy Newell.)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins enjoys a special treat (frozen chicken broth) celebrating his first birthday in his own backyard. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<h3>5. If there is a custody dispute, protect the dog during the battle</h3>\n<p>Although some judges are starting to look at dogs like children and awarding custody based on what is best for the dog, this isn&#8217;t always the case. Many judges see pets as property to be split up. Keisler explains that in some cases, the judge has brought the dog into the courtroom, put a parent on each side, and had them both call out to see who the dog went to. She mentions a case that she read about in which the dog was so confused and upset, he ran to the judge!</p>\n<p>To minimize trauma to your pet, think about what will be best for him. Which one of you is home the most, has the biggest backyard, is stable financially enough to take care of vet bills and other finances related to owning a dog? In short, Keisler suggests, &#8220;Think about what is best for the animal. Leave your ego at the door.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>6. Before adopting a dog as a couple, plan for a breakup</h3>\n<p>It may sound cynical, but Keisler points out that 50 percent of marriages in the U.S. now end in divorce and 40 percent of couples who live together will split up within the first five years. Let&#8217;s be honest, the numbers aren&#8217;t pretty. Keisler suggests, &#8220;Even if you think this is the love of your life, think from the very start of the dog&#8217;s best interest.&#8221; That means a pre-adoption agreement that goes over the ins and outs of co-parenting after your relationship is over.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341449\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341449 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18231316/helping-your-dog-through-a-breakup_2.jpg\" alt=\"Earnest.

(Photo courtesy Kristin von Kreisler)</p></div>\n<p>Keisler&#8217;s final tip is to look for behavior changes in your dog. Some dogs show signs of anxiety, like clinging to an owner, chewing furniture, lack of appetite, or having accidents in the home. If your dog&#8217;s behavior continues to be worrisome or is at any time is drastic, check in with your vet.</p>\n<p><em>Earnest</em> is in stores now.

It was a Saturday, a day my ex often came over to visit us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341191\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341191 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124111/trucker-looking-out-of-upstairs-window-Custom-2-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"trucker looking out of upstairs window (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker watching out of his favorite upstairs window. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>His visits were not only treasured by me, but Trucker loved him. When his SUV pulled into my driveway, Trucker seemed to sense his presence. He’d burst into a flurry of excitement, whimpering with joy to greet him outside or at the back door. Trucker would stop dead in his tracks and sit up on his hind legs, placing his front paws on my ex’s legs to receive and give a hug.</p>\n<p>My ex had three dogs, and he started sharing their dog biscuits with Trucker. Trucker loved the biscuits so much that my ex started carrying a small bag of them in his vehicle. Trucker would climb into the vehicle and find them. But first, Trucker’s nose would go quickly to my ex’s pants pockets or sweatshirt pocket where a couple of biscuits were waiting. Trucker loved the biscuits, but most importantly he loved to “perform” for my ex. He loved pleasing my ex by sitting up, giving a high five, speaking, or rolling over for a treat.</p>\n<p>That day as Trucker was lifeless on my bed, it hit me. I asked him, “Do you miss Daddy?” I always referred to my ex as “Daddy” to Trucker. I told Trucker, “I do too, but I’m sorry, he’s not coming back.”</p>\n<p>At that moment, I collapsed over Trucker <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/hugging-dogs-dog-behavior\" target=\"_blank\">and cried while holding him</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341190\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341190 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15123959/Tracy-holding-Trucker-Custom-2-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy holding Trucker (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Me holding Trucker. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>I’d been through this type of loss before. Nearly 20 years prior when I was married and my husband left me and our <a title=\"Brittany Spaniel\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Brittany\" target=\"_blank\">Brittany Spaniel</a>, Speckles. He was only supposed to be gone three weeks for work, but it grew to three months and a divorce.</p>\n<p>I remember then sitting with Speckles on a cedar chest in front of a picture window in our home. We’d sit there at night watching cars pass by. I knew Speckles was waiting for Daddy’s car to pull into the driveway. I comforted Speckles while sitting there. I became the sole pet parent to “our” dog.</p>\n<p>Now it was happening with Trucker.</p>\n<p>My ex took Trucker jogging, walking, and for rides in his vehicle to his home to play with his dogs. Now it was all gone. I had never wanted Trucker to experience abandonment again. He came into my life when he was 5 years old. He will turn 12 this year. Many people walked out of his life before he met me.</p>\n<p>As a puppy, Trucker was tossed out of a semi truck cab. Someone rescued him and then sold him at a garage sale. The couple who purchased him divorced, and Trucker moved into a new residence with the man. The man’s roommate threatened to hurt Trucker because he tore things up during bouts of separation anxiety. The man surrendered Trucker to a shelter. His ex-wife reclaimed Trucker when she spotted him at a pet adoption fair; however, she returned him to the shelter when he tore up her home due to anxiety.</p>\n<p>Trucker spent five months at the shelter before he met me. He had to be placed on two medications – Prozac and a sedative – just to help him stay calm and not injure himself trying to escape cages while workers were away.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341192\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341192 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124209/trucker-seen-in-upstairs-window-looking-out-Custom-2-600x487.jpg\" alt=\"trucker seen in upstairs window looking out (Custom) (2)\" width=\"600\" height=\"487\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker watching out of his favorite upstairs window. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>So many people gave up on Trucker in his life, causing him sadness and anxiety, until he met me. I had to prove to him that I would always “come back home,” and many dog-loving neighbors have chipped in to help him as comforting pet sitters.</p>\n<p>Trucker allowed my ex to enter our lives, accepting and loving him, only to be left behind.</p>\n<p>Dogs and cats mourn when a close animal pal or their owner dies. Children grieve when a parent abandons them. I’ve seen the same thing happen twice with my pets when a partner has left my life.</p>\n<p>Single parents become more sensitive to whom they let meet their children, and when. They want to protect their children from getting “too close” and facing possible heartache from abandonment again. I have seen my dog and cats mourn and will be careful to protect their gentle hearts from abandonment again.</p>\n<p>While I miss my ex’s dogs, I didn’t initiate breaking ties. I sent them toys for Christmas and think of them often. An adult can say that they no longer love and turn away from another adult, but abandoning the innocence of a pet (or a child) is something inconceivable to me.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341193\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341193 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/15124259/Trucker-sits-on-the-porch-roof-watching-up-the-road-Custom-600x621.jpg\" alt=\"Trucker sits on the porch roof watching up the road (Custom)\" width=\"600\" height=\"621\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trucker sits on the porch roof watching for cars coming up the road. (Photo by Tracy Ahrens)</p></div>\n<p>When my first dog, Speckles, died, I held him as he took his last breath. I did not know if my ex-husband would care to know, but I called him and shared that Speckles was gone.</p>\n<p>I carry on to be a strong pet parent for Trucker, trying to fill the void my ex left in his life. I will always return home to Trucker. I will be with him and hold him until he takes his last breath.</p>\n<p>That is love.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more by </i></b><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/author/tracy-ahrens/\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Tracy Ahrens</i></b></span></a><b><i>: </i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-loves-his-feet-does-your-dog-have-a-favorite-body-part\">My Dog Loves His Feet.

So, pretty much your standard inbox fare &#8212; except Frank is a dog who purports to give out life advice to other dogs, which he communicates by tapping away on an antiquated Macintosh computer.</p>\n<p>Having sensed that this is his grand calling in life, Frank has turned himself into something of <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/askfrank\" target=\"_blank\">the Internet&#8217;s agony uncle</a>, answering emails from confused pooches around the world (and deigning himself to respond to the occasional cat).</p>\n<p>In the interests of improving the lives of both yourself and your dog, here&#8217;s a transcript of my correspondence with Frank.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342586\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342586 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074619/AskFrank2.jpg\" alt=\"AskFrank2\" width=\"600\" height=\"313\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Always take your life advice from dogs. (Photo courtesy Ask Frank)</p></div>\n<p><strong>Dogster: Why did you decide to start giving out advice to other dogs?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Frank:</strong> Well, making humans smile is my mission in life. I&#8217;m good at it; like really good at it. My friends would always say, “Frank, how are you so good at making humans smile?&#8221; and “Why are you so good looking?” (Okay, they didn&#8217;t really say that last part. But I do look good.)</p>\n<p>Then I realized some of my furry friends struggled to make their humans smile. I couldn&#8217;t let that be. Inside every dog and cat is the ability to make a human happy. Sometimes, my furry friends just need a little extra help to make it happen, and I want to give them that.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342587\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342587 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074740/AskFrank5.png\" alt=\"AskFrank5\" width=\"600\" height=\"607\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Can I ask what qualifies you to be giving out life advice to other dogs?</strong></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a good question, Phil. Making humans smile isn’t just a hobby &#8212; it’s my life’s work. I own a business called From Frank that produces greeting cards and gifts all made by me and my four best furry friends &#8212; Walter, Big Louie, Lulu McFluff, and Izzy &#8212; with the sole goal of making humans smile.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also a certified therapy dog: I visit hospitals and rehab centers and participate in a children&#8217;s reading program at our local library.</p>\n<p>Throughout my work, I&#8217;ve gathered experience on just what does and doesn&#8217;t make a human smile. I&#8217;ve even written a book on the subject, <em>Don&#8217;t Fart When You Snuggle: Lessons on How to Make a Human Smile</em>, which is on sale now at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Fart-When-You-Snuggle/dp/1452141770\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. (Shameless plug, I know.)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342591\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342591 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074835/AskFrank1.png\" alt=\"AskFrank1\" width=\"600\" height=\"594\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Less of the shameless plugs please, Frank. Let&#8217;s get back to the script: Can you remember the very first piece of advice you gave out?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, it was accidental advice, really. You see, my good friend Big Louie farts a lot. One day he was sitting against the baseboard in our house and let one rip. As that fart bounced off the baseboard with magnificent loudness, a lightbulb came on for me: I said, &#8220;Louie, do you think you can do that again when our human gets home?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was like, &#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So we tried the technique on our human, and she laughed so hard. And that&#8217;s how I discovered that farting on baseboards makes your farts way louder and more awesome. It&#8217;s a technique Big Louie still relies on and that I still recommend to my friends today.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342592\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342592 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074857/AskFrank6.png\" alt=\"AskFrank6\" width=\"600\" height=\"571\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m not entirely sure that qualifies as actual advice, Frank, but let&#8217;s keep this moving. What&#8217;s the weirdest situation you&#8217;ve been asked to advise on?</strong></p>\n<p>One friend asked me if it was OK to hump his sister. It’s actually a valid question since they weren’t from the same litter. But as a rule, I don’t recommend humping housemates.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep it classy, Frank. So, what sort of feedback do you usually get once you&#8217;ve given a dog some advice?</strong></p>\n<p>Generally, my advice works most of the time, every time. Sometimes results are instantaneous. And sometimes the advice takes a little longer to pan out. For example, last I knew, <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/ask-frank/2016/1/21/seats-taken-1\" target=\"_blank\">my friend Barry was still waiting for the beans to kick in</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342593\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-342593 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074918/AskFrank4.png\" alt=\"AskFrank4\" width=\"600\" height=\"567\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>That just seems to be another link to you talking about farting as a solution to all of life&#8217;s little problems. Let&#8217;s switch it up. I noticed from your website you seem to use a clunky-looking, old-fashioned computer. Any plans to upgrade from the &#8217;80s anytime soon?</strong></p>\n<p>I use a Macintosh SE – MC68000 processor, 1MB of memory, 1.4MB of high-density disk capacity, and a 9-inch screen. If it&#8217;s not broke, don&#8217;t fix it, Phil.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a dog go about typing on a keyboard, Frank?</strong></p>\n<p>Well, I YouTubed &#8220;How to type on a keyboard with paws.” Oddly, I didn&#8217;t find anything very helpful. So I just taught myself. The hardest part is when sometimes you want to type, say, “hot dog,” and it turns out as “has fog,” which doesn’t really make sense.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342596\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342596 size-full\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27074952/AskFrank3.png\" alt=\"AskFrank3\" width=\"600\" height=\"599\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fromfranktm/\">Instagram</a>.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Your bio boasts that you&#8217;re &#8220;quite the ladies man.&#8221; Which celebrity dogs do you have your eye on?</strong></p>\n<p>Guilty as charged, Phil. I love all the ladies. But if you&#8217;re making me pick, I would have to say my particular favorites are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/toastmeetsworld/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Toast</a>, <a title=\"Maddie the Coonhound\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/maddie-on-things-theron-humphrey-viral-dog-photos\" target=\"_blank\">Maddie the Coonhound</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sadietripawd/\" target=\"_blank\">Sadie Tripawd</a>. The tongue, the legs.

How would you advise other dogs to go about making humans smile?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna get deep here for a minute, Phil. Come with me. So, when you make a human smile, it makes them happy. Happy humans make other humans happy. And then these other happy humans make more humans happy. It&#8217;s like a chain reaction that can spread like wildfire.</p>\n<p>You still with me, Phil?</p>\n<p>And all it takes to start the reaction is one human smile. It&#8217;s simple and small, but powerful. My advice to my fuzzy friends would be: Just have good intentions. If your goal is truly to make your human smile, and you really want that deep down in your little fuzzy heart, then no matter what technique you try, no matter if you get it right or wrong, your human will see your intentions and ultimately smile.</p>\n<p><strong>So, what makes <em>you</em> smile, Frank?</strong></p>\n<p>Has fogs. Ugh. I meant hot dogs. See?</p>\n<p>Mosey on over to <a href=\"http://www.fromfrank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frank&#8217;s website</a> to read up on all the life advice you could possibly want.

              "<p>When we have a pet in our lives, trips to the veterinarian are routine. Appointments for annual checkups, minor health problems, and injuries are all included in our roles as pet protectors and loving parents. Unfortunately, these vet visits occasionally take a dramatic and unexpected turn. What may begin as a “typical” or “hopeful” appointment can end with our pet receiving a serious diagnosis.</p>\n<p>And as the vet utters words like “chronic,” “not curable,” or “terminal,” we may find ourselves feeling overwhelmed, confused, sad, and even helpless. These powerful emotions can make it difficult for both new and experienced pet guardians to remember that at this time, we have rights.</p>\n<p>I believe that these five rights specifically, when claimed and acted upon, can help us more effectively handle a difficult diagnosis with strength and do all we can for our beloved pet.</p>\n<h3>1. Before we leave the vet’s office, we have the right to ask for complete, detailed information</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342696\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342696\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27091818/shutterstock_305880713-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Veterinarian with dog by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-305880713/stock-photo-veterinarian.html?src=T_kWGXZzLYnmgT5Q2tbDMQ-1-32\">Veterinarian with dog</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The vet can provide us with her professional knowledge, consult resources available at the clinic, and also recommend sites and literature for us to review on our own. As I have personally experienced (when my pet, Brynn, was diagnosed with diabetes), we often receive just a brief (and not entirely clear) “snapshot” of the disease or condition. This may lead us to quickly accept the first response plan provided (perhaps not the most complete and optimal choice).</p>\n<p>If, instead, we remember that that we have the ability and the right to learn as much as we can about the condition, its origin, its expected progression, and what symptoms indicate a “crisis,” we will be able to move forward in a manner that better helps both us and our pet.</p>\n<h3>2. We have the right to seek a second opinion and even a specialist about our pet’s diagnosis</h3>\n<p>And while we can search for these medical professionals on our own, we can also insist that our primary vet provide us a recommendation and a referral.</p>\n<p>This right became evident to me when my first dog, Fargo, was suffering from a serious skin infection on her tail. My husband and I came home from work one evening and noticed crimson marks low on the staircase wall, as if someone had been splattering paint while crawling from the first to second floor and back. Concerned and confused, we inspected Fargo’s body and found two open lesions on her extremely long and wildly active (often responsible for knocking untethered items off low surfaces) tail. We took her to our primary veterinarian, who diagnosed a skin infection and prescribed an antibiotic.</p>\n<p>Two weeks passed with no improvement. In fact, her tail’s condition worsened. Every night, we encountered a new bloody trail on the staircase wall. We took her back to the vet and came home with a new antibiotic and a “tail wrap” strategy. But the condition continued.</p>\n<p>On our third trip to the vet, we were told that her tail’s infection was just not responding to antibiotics and then received the “not curable” diagnosis and a recommendation to schedule tail amputation surgery. At that point, I asked my veterinarian if she knew of an animal skin care specialist in town (she did) and requested a referral. The referral was made. The specialist was able to test Fargo’s tail lesions more thoroughly and discovered a “resilient” bacterium (responsive to selective antibiotics only) as the cause of the infection. After being prescribed the effective antibiotic, my Fargo was able to keep her “action” tail!</p>\n<h3>3. We have the right to research alternative or holistic treatment options to possibly add (after discussion with our vet) to the conventional treatment plan</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_342698\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342698\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27092240/shutterstock_311602700-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Dog on a massage table by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-308901824/stock-photo-dog-relaxing-on-massage-table-on-light-background.html?src=cPgTrlbAIjjvdXtHxux9-Q-1-3\">Dog on a massage table</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>This may include supplements, diet changes, massage, or even a specialized holistic or integrated veterinary professional to add your pet’s treatment team. I acted on this right when my dog Dakota was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-you-need-to-know-if-your-dog-gets-diagnosed-with-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a>. In addition to seeing our primary vet and following her treatment plan, I took Dakota to an integrated healing clinic for their recommendation on diet alterations and supplements. With all her medical professionals informed and consenting to the overall response plan, I was able to believe that Dakota had a fully considered and well-rounded approach to combat the illness.</p>\n<h3>4. We have the right to consult our veterinarian and other professional resources on how to gauge our pet’s quality of life</h3>\n<p>What symptoms indicate a decline? And <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-pet-euthanasia-decision-death-loss-of-a-pet-goodbye\" target=\"_blank\">how can we determine our pet’s level of pain?</a> Too often, we are unsure of what to look for and do not know when our pet’s life is becoming too hard for him to bear. We can, however, educate ourselves with the help of professionals and get at least a little closer to understanding the levels of enjoyment, interest, and comfort our pet is experiencing.</p>\n<h3>5. Lastly, we have the right to feel the way we feel when our pet is diagnosed</h3>\n<p>We do not have to hide our emotions and be embarrassed by them. And if our feelings are too powerful to handle alone or with the help of friends and family, we have the right to seek professional support during our pet’s struggle. Participating in pet illness and loss support groups or seeing a counselor during this time can allow us to share feelings and gain understanding. Consulting pet grief literature and online sources may provide us with the help we need as well.</p>\n<p>My wish for all devoted pet parents throughout the lifetime of our pets is a series of easy, uneventful vet visits. But if an appointment results in a difficult diagnosis, just remember, we have the ability to claim and act upon our rights. This can allow us to move from our initial emotional place of shock and powerlessness to one of feeling ready to do all that we can — for our pets and for ourselves.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more about your dog&#8217;s health:</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/ask-a-vet-can-dogs-suffer-from-glaucoma\"><b>Ask a Vet: Can Dogs Suffer From Glaucoma?</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-age-do-puppies-lose-their-teeth\"><b>What Age Do Puppies Lose Their Teeth?</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-my-dogs-gained-weight-on-a-healthy-all-natural-dog-food\"><b>Why My Dogs Gained Weight on a Healthy, All-Natural Dog Food</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Chris Corrigan Mendez, M.Ed., PLPC, NCC, is a professional counselor in private practice and the proud guardian of four rescue pooches.

Matt is a sergeant with the police department in Arlington, Texas; his job sometimes ends with people going to jail. Melanie is a social worker serving as a commander in the United States Public Health Service for the Federal Bureau of Prisons; she works in a women’s correctional institution. Every day, they both see people at their worst, but through their involvement in the <a href=\"http://www.cci.org/site/c.cdKGIRNqEmG/b.6097761/k.7684/Prison_Puppy_Raising.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Canine Companions for Independence Prison Puppy Raising program</a>, they also get to see the very best of people (and dogs) helping people.</p>\n<p>With encouragement from a community member already involved with service dog work, Melanie created a service dog puppy-raising program at the facility where she works in 2007. In 2009, they began their current partnership with <a href=\"http://www.cci.org/site/c.cdKGIRNqEmG/b.3978475/k.BED8/Home.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Canine Companions for Independence</a>. Future service dogs are bred by Canine Companions in Santa Rosa, California, and puppies are flown to the Dallas/Fort Worth area at eight weeks old to begin their training at a women’s minimum-security facility. Women inmates who are approved to work with the program can have a variety of responsibilities, but each of the six puppies in a “class” has a primary caregiver who lives with the dog, as well as a backup caregiver and several volunteers.</p>\n<p>The program gives responsibility and purpose to the inmates, things that may have been lacking in some of their lives before this opportunity arose. And it seems to make a huge difference. According to Melanie, there has been a zero percent &#8212; yes, zero percent &#8212; recidivism rate amongst their <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/weekends-with-daisy-dog-book-excerpt-prison-dogs-sharron-kahn-luttrell\" target=\"_blank\">puppy-raising inmates</a>. A testament to the program, to be sure, but also to the very idea of service animals. Clearly, it is not just the eventual owners who benefit.</p>\n<p>As Melanie put it, “For many, a light is turned on in them, showing this entire other world of <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dogs-on-the-inside-documentary-movie-prison-dog-training\" target=\"_blank\">volunteerism and giving to others</a>. They are proud of what they do with their time and appreciate the opportunity.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342662\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342662 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085204/Hanna-Matt-Target-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Matt with Hannah, one of the puppies he and his wife have helped raise. (Photo courtesy Matt and )\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Matt with Hannah, one of the puppies he and his wife, Melanie, have helped raise. (Photo courtesy Matt and Melanie Pedersen)</p></div>\n<p>While the inmates are chiefly responsible for the care and socialization of the puppies, the program also utilizes weekend puppy raisers outside of the system to be sure the puppies are exposed to a variety of different people and situations in their formative years. After working the program from the inside since 2007, Melanie (and Matt) became weekend puppy raisers for the program in 2009. Initially, they just stepped in to help when another staff member was unable to continue with her puppy, but after the first experience, they were hooked. They have now helped raise four puppies for Canine Companions.</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie have always been “dog people.” So much so, that as a kid, Matt wanted to be a K9 handler. Between the small number of openings for those types of positions in his department and the timing of other career milestones, that opportunity never arose. So Matt was understandably pleased when they were able to participate in this program.</p>\n<p>Says Matt, “As a first responder, we are always dealing with people on the front ­end of the criminal justice process and rarely learn what happens to them if they end up incarcerated. It is heart­warming to know that programs exist at the local and federal level that not only benefit non­profit organizations and the recipients who receive service dogs, but the inmates who are involved in these programs.”</p>\n<p>I suppose now would be a good time to disclose that Matt is my cousin. And I regularly stalk their puppies on social media. I have seen adorable photos of all of their pups. Pups at the hardware store, pups at the lake, pups not eating the sushi display at the grocery store &#8212; you name it. A large part of their job is to take the pups wherever they go and to maximize exposure to the different people and scenarios they may meet later in life.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342665\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342665 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085337/Hanna-Mel-firetruck-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Hanna Mel firetruck\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Melanie with Hannah. (Photo courtesy Matt and Melanie Pedersen)</p></div>\n<p>But I know there is more to it than fun outings and adorable photos. For one, they need to not undo all the hard work their weekday raisers have done. Matt and Melanie are responsible for continuing the education and socialization and for teaching the puppies how to learn, so that they will be ready for their professional training at the end of the 18-month puppy raising period. And that’s the other thing. The end of the puppy-raising period comes. Every time. Ready or not.</p>\n<p>When that happens, Matt and Melanie turn the puppies &#8212; now dogs &#8212; over to Canine Companions for Independence. The dogs then go through an extensive medical workup, at the end of which, if they pass, they begin their professional training. Throughout training, Matt and Melanie receive periodic updates in the form of monthly report cards. Not all dogs go on to be matched with recipients, but if their dogs get pre-matched, they get notified, and if the dogs continue and graduate, Matt and Melanie are invited to the graduation ceremony, where they get to reconnect with their puppy and meet the recipient. When it’s their pup’s turn, they walk their dog across a stage and hand the leash to the new owner.</p>\n<p>Says Melanie, “It’s the proudest moment, and you understand the importance of your role as a puppy raiser in this process. When people ask “How can you give the dog up?” This is why. You had a job to do as a puppy raiser and now the pup has a job to do­­ help someone who needs it.”</p>\n<p>I asked both Matt and Melanie what they considered their favorite and least favorite things about puppy raising. For Melanie, it was two things. No. 1? “Good old fashioned puppy time &#8212; pure joy and love.” The other was “seeing the pup we helped raise fulfill the greater purpose as a service dog.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342667\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342667\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/27085441/Zack_Sedona2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Sedona, another of the puppies Matt and Melanie helped raise, went on to be the service animal for Zack Collie. (Photo courtesy Amber Collie)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sedona, another of the puppies Matt and Melanie helped raise, went on to be the service animal for Zack Collie. (Photo courtesy Amber Collie)</p></div>\n<p>Matt’s favorite thing? Aside from the puppy bonding, he says, “Talking to people in the community and getting the word out about Canine Companions when we are on puppy outings and exposure training. The dogs (and the raisers) become ambassadors for the program, so it is nice to get a chance to talk up Canine Companions and the great work they do around the country and in our South Central Region.”</p>\n<p>As for least favorite? It’s picking up poop.</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie have weekend-raised four dogs for Canine Companions. One of them, Sedona, was chosen to assist quadriplegic college student Zack Collie and one was chosen for the Canine Companions breeding program. Of the other two, one is still in advanced training and one ended up being placed as a pet. (Melanie referred to it as a “career change.”)</p>\n<p>The prison where Melanie runs the program is now raising puppies Nos. 43 to 48 since the program was established. (There have been 24 to 29 puppies for Canine Companions total, with the others with a previous partner organization.) They have learned a lot, and so I asked them what advice they would give to anyone considering doing this amazing work. Both stressed the importance of understanding the commitment. Both in terms of time and in following the rules of the program.</p>\n<p>Matt points out that as weekend raisers, they are in a unique position, but that full-time raising takes full-time commitment. He says other puppy raisers are a great resource for advice and perspective. Melanie added that the organization has staff who are there to help you be the best puppy raiser you can be.</p>\n<p>She summed it up this way: “Puppy raising is an amazing gift that you can give to someone who needs that pup. But only take on this calling if you know you can follow the rules and understand that this pup has a mission that is greater than an individual’s need for a pet dog. If someone wants another pet, then get another pet. If someone wants to make a difference in another’s life through a dog, then be a puppy raiser.”</p>\n<p>Matt and Melanie inspire me. They and the dogs they are helping to raise are making a difference.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><b>Read about more Dogster Heroes:</b></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/sydney-and-sassy-get-their-puppy-nails-cut-with-the-zen-clipper\"><b>Sydney and Sassy Get Their Puppy Nails Cut With the Zen Clipper</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/10-photos-that-prove-dogs-plus-baby-goats-equals-magic\"><b>10 Photos That Prove Dogs Plus Baby Goats Equals Magic</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/coop-the-coonhound-tests-tomlyn-relax-and-calm-chews\"><b>Coop the Coonhound Tests Tomlyn Relax &amp; Calm Chews</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Lisa Seger (who goes by Blue Heron Farm on most social media platforms) is a former office drone turned dairy farmer and cheesemaker.

              "<p>My lifelong friend Mary Steiner is physically disabled; she lives as a “shut-in.” Essentially, she lives life in a large La-Z-Boy chair. Mary is morbidly obese and cannot walk.</p>\n<p>Her trouble started after she lost her job as the food service director at a nursing home. Mary loved that job. Losing it sent her into a major depression, and she became completely inactive. She began to put on more and more weight, and ultimately got to the point where she is today. She’s been housebound since 2008.</p>\n<p>Her husband, Garry, takes care of Mary day and night. Garry is a retired truck driver. Even though they have hard lives, they are two of the funniest people I’ve met. Mary’s sense of humor keeps her alive, and, sometimes, when I’m depressed I call her to be cheered up. Actually, we cheer each other up. We’ve been friends since we were babies. Our mothers were best friends from childhood.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342503\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342503\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26132634/laura-1-600x358.jpg\" alt=\"The author, Laura Yeager (at left), and her lifelong friend Mary Steiner.

(Photo courtesy Laura Yeager)</p></div>\n<p>Mary’s life would be even harder if it weren’t for her three dogs. They are like Mary and Garry’s kids. First there’s Kenzie, or Momma; she’s a mixture of <a title=\"Labrador\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador </a>and<a title=\"Chow\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/breeds/Chow_Chow\" target=\"_blank\"> Chow</a>. “This one is the queen of the house,” Mary states. Garry adds, “Kenzie won’t eat unless she’s hand-fed.” Mary and Garry got this dog eight years ago at a dog adoption event called Pets in the Park, in Akron, Ohio. Kenzie was only 8 weeks old.</p>\n<p>Then, there’s 6-year-old Mogley; he’s a Labrador Retriever. Garry states, “I wanted to name him after Mowgli from <em>Jungle Book</em>, but I had no idea how to spell it, so he became Mogley.” Garry recounts the story of how he was found. “It was minus 4 degrees outside. I saw this dog in the middle of the street looking up at cars. It was like he’d just been dropped off. The dog came close to being hit several times. I stopped and opened my passenger door. This guy climbed up and lay down on my lap and wouldn’t get off. I circled the area for an hour to see if anyone was looking for him. Then, I took him home and walked him into the house. Kenzie didn’t want anything to do with him. Mogley ate two bowls of Bil-Jac. He was very dirty, so I gave him a hot shower.” And the rest is history.</p>\n<p>Finally, Buddy, the purebred <a title=\"German Shepherd\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\" target=\"_blank\">German Shepherd, </a>completes the pack. Four-year-old Buddy wandered around Mary and Garry’s neighborhood for three or four months. People tried to catch him with food. “One day, I sat and pitched Milk-Bones at him,” Garry states, but he didn’t have any luck luring the dog. Sooner or later, the stray befriended Mogley on one of their walks. Then, the stray followed Garry and Mogely all around the block and into the garage. The shy dog followed them into the house and never left.</p>\n<p>All sweet dogs, these guys are Mary’s best friends, her kids, and &#8212; often &#8212; her lifeline. As mentioned, Mary&#8217;s husband of 17 years cares for her. For instance, if Mary needs help and Garry is out in the garage, he can’t hear her yelling his name. So Mary calls him even louder, and the dogs join in, howling so that Garry knows that Mary is in need. Works every time. Garry comes in and assists Mary.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342504\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342504\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26132756/laura-2-600x448.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Yeager with her friend's pack, Buddy, Kenzie, and Mogley.

(Photo courtesy Laura Yeager)</p></div>\n<p>Mary says the dogs are also her protection. Completely immobile, she can&#8217;t defend herself if someone breaks into the house. The dogs’ barking scares any predators away. “When those three get going, I don’t think anyone would try to enter our home.” Mary states, “The Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses won’t even come on the porch. I lucked out there.”</p>\n<p>Garry told me that he trained the dogs to attack those who might try to harm Mary. “I pretended I was slapping her. The dogs didn’t like that. They got the idea that I wanted them to guard Mary day and night.” Garry feels dogs are much better than home alarm systems. When asked why, he states, “Dogs go off if they see a stranger out in the yard. With alarms, the predator has to be breaking into the house for the alarm to sound.”</p>\n<p>The dogs are also entertainment. They play a unique game called “tukaroopalooza.” Mary and Garry made this game up. They give their dogs the cardboard cylinders from paper towel rolls (tukaroos), and the dogs are allowed to dash around the house and chew up the cardboard rolls. Mary says this keeps the dogs from chewing other things that matter, like furniture and shoes.</p>\n<p>Mary says, “My whole world revolves around my dogs.” Dogs can do wonderful things for shut-ins like Mary Steiner.</p>\n<p>I’m praying for the day when Mary can leave the house and jump in a car and go shopping with me. Or go to lunch. Or take the dogs to a park and play Frisbee with them. Before Mary became housebound, she loved to go camping with a large circle of friends. Mary’s circle of friends is praying for her. We’re all praying for Mary, our beloved Mary. She is the strongest person I know.</p>\n<p>Until Mary can leave the house again, Kenzie, Mogley and Buddy will keep Mary’s spirits up. Thank God for dogs.</p>\n<p>Do you know of dogs who make their people&#8217;s lives better?

(Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>Here are just a few of the items I have purchased &#8212; again and again until I found the right ones, in many cases &#8212; over the past 10-plus years of Riggins&#8217; life:</p>\n<h3>1. Collars</h3>\n<p>When Riggins was a puppy, I didn&#8217;t know much about dogs. To me, a collar was a collar. I grabbed one from my local chain pet store and happily snapped it around his neck. It wasn&#8217;t until later, when I started reading and learning about other collar types, that I realized I may need <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/choke-prong-shock-collars-for-dogs-dog-health-tips-injuries\" target=\"_blank\">to find something safer</a> for my sweet baby.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342245\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342245\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_8-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Back to the basics!\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Back to the basics! (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-riggins-is-a-full-partner-in-my-dog-sitting-business\" target=\"_blank\">As a dog sitter</a>, a handful of the pups I watch wear <a href=\"http://www.mellycollars.com/about-us/why-martingales/\" target=\"_blank\">Martingale collars</a>. This style slips over your dog&#8217;s head and then has a loop that gets tighter when pulled. When used correctly, the collar is loose 99 percent of the time, only constricting to the circumference of your dog&#8217;s neck when he pulls on his leash. Riggins&#8217; neck is so much bigger than his head that it is possible for him to slip out of a regular collar. Something he has done more than once. Obviously, the Martingale style was safer.</p>\n<p>That is, until I read about how you needed it take it off whenever the dog was not on a walk because the same design element that keeps your dog from slipping out while on leash can have deadly results if caught on a fence, plant, or another dog&#8217;s teeth. Aaaaahhhhh! How horrifying. It was time to try again.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342248\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342248\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_11-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins in his Martingale collar which he should not have on when not on leash.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins in his Martingale collar, which he should not have on when not on the leash. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>At a pet first aid session, the instructor said that, in her opinion, every dog should wear a breakaway collar. She didn&#8217;t have to tell me twice, although that collar didn&#8217;t last long. After a few times of me grabbing Riggins&#8217; collar to stop him from chasing someone or something only to be left in his dust holding a collar in my hand, we went back to a tried-and-true clipping collar.</p>\n<h3>2. The right leash</h3>\n<p>I started out with a standard leash. Six feet. Black. Nylon. Riggins&#8217; first leash had a <a href=\"http://www.usalanyards.com/push-gate-snap-hooks.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">push-gate snap hook</a> (I had to look that up just now; I had no idea what it was called). It was shiny and pretty, but after about a year, Riggins was able to walk away free from the restraint of his leash. I finally figured out it was the darn useless clasp on his lead, which could open on its own. I did what any sane person would do and bought a different style of leash.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342246\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342246\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_9-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"The bolt snap!\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bolt snap! (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>Our next purchase had a good ol&#8217; fashioned <a href=\"http://www.usalanyards.com/medium-bolt-snaps.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">bolt snap</a> (I had to look that up, too). That worked well, but then I discovered something called a traffic lead. A traffic lead is essentially just a big loop handle. It is very short and keeps your dog close to you, giving him very little leeway to wander.</p>\n<p>At the time, we lived on a VERY traffic-heavy street, and, well, the new shorter lead had &#8220;traffic&#8221; in its name. It had to be better than what I was using, and it was, for the most part. As brilliant as the traffic lead is (and I&#8217;m a big supporter of it), it wasn&#8217;t useful for anything but very deliberate walks when we were practicing &#8220;walking pretty&#8221; (him close to my side and in stride with me). For everyday use, it was more trouble than it was worth.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342239\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342239\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_2-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"His newest walking harness and hybrid leash.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">His newest walking harness and hybrid leash. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>Which leads me to the leash style I have used ever since. It&#8217;s a hybrid, a long normal leash with a traffic lead tacked on at the end and with a bolt snap attachment. Perfect for when you are walking and need to pull your pup close for a bit. Sure, every once in a while, Riggins&#8217; leg gets stuck in the traffic lead loop, but it&#8217;s a small price to pay for overall comfort and safety!</p>\n<h3>3. Car restraints</h3>\n<p>Riggins has always worn a canine seat belt while in the car. At this point, he expects it &#8212; and the few times he hasn&#8217;t worn it, he won&#8217;t get out of the car until I &#8220;unhook&#8221; him. He will just sit there and wait. I&#8217;ll tell him it&#8217;s okay, but he will look at me as if to say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t fool me. You need to unbuckle me first.&#8221; So I pretend to unbuckle him, and we go on our way. Don&#8217;t believe me? Take a look:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXkFBZ3dVuk?rel=0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>We started with a standard chest-covered halter that had a loop in the back for the human seat belt to go through. We had a few of those. I loved the first one he had because it was padded with cotton on the chest area, and I thought that made it comfortable. That is, until we were hiking in the summer (he kept his halter on when we hiked), and I decided it made him too warm. So I switched to one with less coverage on the chest, but that one didn&#8217;t last long since I decided it wasn&#8217;t as comfortable. I went back to the padded style.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342243\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342243\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_6-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking in one of his older padded car restraint harnesses.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hiking in one of his older padded car-restraint harnesses. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t finished yet. After I did an <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-seatbelts-car-restraints-safety-harness-sleepypod-solvit\" target=\"_blank\">article on car restraint safety</a>, I had no choice but to get my darling baby boy the <em>only </em>design that is certified by the Center for Pet Safety, which crash tested a number of styles, including our choice, the <a href=\"http://sleepypod.com/clickit-sport\" target=\"_blank\">Sleepypod Clickit Sport</a>. Of course, as great as the Clickit Sport is at keeping Riggins safe in the car, it is a horrible walking harness. That meant I needed to purchase a new harness to use on hikes once he got out of the car.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342242\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342242\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/25063944/Keeping-Riggins-Safe_5-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"When he still hiked in his Clickit Sport.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">When he still hiked in his Clickit Sport. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>Look at all that money I have spent searching for the safest items for my dog. But I&#8217;d do it all again!

              "<p>Like many of you, I hate going to the dentist.</p>\n<p>I actually like my current dentist as a person, but I hate what his profession represents to me: pain. His name is <a href=\"https://www.durangodentistry.com/\">Dr. Greg Mann</a>, and as the world’s most patient dentist he is helping me learn to trust his kind again. He’s doing that in much the same way I help scared dogs learn to trust their environment again. I’ll explain how below; first a little more about my unlucky history with dentists.</p>\n<p>When I was young and impressionable, I had four teeth pulled &#8212; it hurt. Then I had my wisdom teeth pulled &#8212; that also hurt. When I was a young adult, I had a really awful dentist who did not wait long enough for me to get numb (it happened more than once), and he went ahead with a root canal. I became squirmy and complained as best as I could with his hands in my mouth and tools hacking away. Touching raw nerves HURTS.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342512\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342512\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26135359/shutterstock_364586690-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Woman at dentist's office by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-364586690/stock-photo-teenage-girl-at-dental-office.html?src=VM15nwH28mEpS1GZ0QOE4w-1-31\">Woman at dentist&#8217;s office</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>The doctor stopped drilling, looked at me angrily, and said: “You have two choices. You can squeeze my assistant’s hand real hard and let me finish, or we can stop and call an ambulance, and you are going to the hospital to finish this there.” I chose to squeeze because I just wanted to get out of his presence as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>I never went back to that dentist. I did note it when he landed on the front page of the local paper, however. He was “playing around” with the nitrous gas after work one night and blew up his dental office. Oops. Not exactly a stellar dentist or one I want anywhere near me or my teeth. One bad experience &#8212; and I have had way more than one &#8212; can cause a sense of fear and apprehension that is hard if not impossible to control, even with the help of the funny gas.</p>\n<p>How does my fear at the dentist’s office relate to dog training? One scary incident with a person or another dog (and remember, the dog determines what is scary) can leave a dog fearful of those things, particularly when it happens to a vulnerable, young dog. Many dogs learn to warn off potential threats with distance-increasing behavior, such as lunging and barking.</p>\n<p>While I don’t bark or growl at my dentist, I have bolted in fear from the dental chair. The old dentists gave no heed to my concerns, bulldozed their way around my mouth, and then tried to blame ME when I protested in real pain. They tried to shame me into shutting up. Imagine if they put a shock collar on me and delivered a zap anytime I disobeyed or complained. I could either sink into hopelessness and choose to not fight the pain or I could bite the source of the pain and bite hard (FYI, I would bite).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342513\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342513 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26135630/shutterstock_363249413-e1453845519909-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"Dog ready to bite by Shutterstock.\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-363249413/stock-photo-profile-head-shot-of-mad-dog-growling-and-showing-teeth-isolated-on-white-background.html?src=dc-2zQhxZYciigO1vooNLA-1-4\">Dog ready to bite</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>My new dentist chose to help me through my apprehension. One tool he used that I also employ with fearful dogs is desensitizing, or taking things slowly. He told me right away that he understood my fear. He then promised he would never proceed if I was not completely numbed. Talk is all good, but I still had my hackles up from years of bad dental care. My wise dentist went slowly. It was two years of appointments before he actually numbed my mouth and fixed a crown. It took two years of no pain during visits for me to begin to trust him.</p>\n<p>The other thing Dr. Mann did and still does is to explain his steps before and during treatments. At one point, I pulled the gas nozzle off my nose and told him it made me feel claustrophobic. He said, no problem, and told me that many of his patients have felt that way. He then loosened the mask so it wasn’t pulling so tightly against my nose. I ripped it off one more time and told him my heart was racing. He told me that was because the numbing medication had an additive in it that acted like adrenaline and that caused an increased heart rate in some people. I then understood why my heart was beating so rapidly in spite of the funny gas. His explanation made perfect sense to me, and it helped calm me down.</p>\n<p>He did one other thing that was crucial to my being able to not bolt from the chair. Dr. Mann said, “If at any point for any reason you need a break, raise your hand and I will immediately stop.” Being a cynic, I tested him. Twice. He stopped immediately, both times. What he did is give me a sense of CONTROL over my own body and my own fear. It worked.</p>\n<p>How does all of this relate to helping dogs?</p>\n<p>We use desensitizing to help a dog be able to look at or be around his trigger &#8212; whatever sets him off (often another dog). We never flood a dog, which means we don’t overwhelm the dog with something that scares him too quickly or too closely. We move slowly over time and from a distance, just as a good dentist doesn’t walk into your first appointment and start hacking away in your mouth without a detailed briefing of his plan and ensuring you feel OK about the situation (of course, things may proceed differently if there is a true dental emergency, but even then a good dentist explains his actions and checks in on you).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341427\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-341427 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18170046/rayandannie-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"rayandannie\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My dog Radar is well trained and well versed in helping me help fearful dogs. (Photo by Annie Phenix)</p></div>\n<p>While I can’t tell a fearful dog that I am going to bring a safe dog into the room for him to see, dogs do make predictions. After a dog in training is comfortable with me, I leave the room to get my calm, highly trained <a title=\"Border Collie\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Border_Collie\" target=\"_blank\">Border Collie </a>Radar. I go in and out of the training room a few times with Radar, and the fearful dog sees him from a safe distance (the dog’s behavior tells me if he feels safe or not). He is quickly able to predict that Radar will stay away from him and that he is safe because Radar completely ignores him, and we are far enough away to not get the dog aroused or apprehensive. This is my way of telling the dog what is about to happen without the benefit of language.</p>\n<p>The last component is choice over one’s environment. We have to keep the dogs on leashes for safety, but we allow the dog to look at my dog if he chooses. We allow the dog to eat (or not eat if he is too amped up, and that tells me to start even farther away) the delicious meat training treats that fall from the sky the second the dog sees my dog. We allow the dog to turn and look at his handler, turning his head away from the once scary other dog in the room, and we reinforce that with a very happy, smiling human handler, who hands out yum-o treats for the dog being able to make the choice to look away and at his handler.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is the first time in that dog’s life that he felt safe enough to turn his head away from another dog. He’s able to do it because we made sure he felt safe, we went slowly, and we worked from a distance. We reinforced the behavior we wanted.</p>\n<p>The beauty of it all is that it takes teamwork, and perhaps for the first time, the human handler becomes a source of predicted calmness, who learns to reinforce the calm behavior she always wanted from her dog.

              "<p>Kurgo has a line of dog travel products, many of which work to minimize driver distraction. Knowing I often have a pack of dogs in my car &#8212; <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-riggins-is-a-full-partner-in-my-dog-sitting-business\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;m a dog sitter </a>&#8212; the company sent over three to try out: <a href=\"http://www.kurgo.com/dog-travel/direct-to-seat-belt-tether/\" target=\"_blank\">the Direct to Seat Belt Tether</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kurgo.com/dog-travel/kurgo-auto-zip-line-leash-zip-line-combo/\" target=\"_blank\">the Auto Zip Line-Leash/Zip Line Combo</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.kurgo.com/dog-travel/backseat-barrier/\" target=\"_blank\">Backseat Barrier</a>. We took them for a test drive.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: My dog, Riggins, uses a Sleepypod ClickIt Sport Harness. After doing research for <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-seatbelts-car-restraints-safety-harness-sleepypod-solvit\" target=\"_blank\">an article on the safety of car restraint harnesses for dogs</a>, I decided it was the product Riggins would use while we are on the road.</p>\n<p>But as mentioned, he isn&#8217;t the only pup in my vehicle most of the time. Usually between three and seven dogs pile in. Most of the dog parents don&#8217;t use or provide a car-restraint harness, so it is often up to me to find ways to keep the dogs out of my lap. Here is what we experienced while using the Kurgo products.</p>\n<h3>Direct to Seat Belt Tether</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340325\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340325\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220816/Kurgo_driver_distration_7-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Clicking in the seatbelt tether. (All photos by Wendy Newell)\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clicking in the seat belt tether. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>This doggie seat belt is a simple yet effective concept. The tether has a latch plate on one side and a carabiner on the other. Simply click the latch plate into the female side of the seat belt in your car and hook the other end to your dog&#8217;s harness. Ta-da! Now your pup can only wander the length of the tether.</p>\n<p>Although Kurgo sent me one of these products to review, I already own and use one. In fact, I&#8217;ve tried a number of different brands of this type of tether design and like Kurgo&#8217;s the best. It is hefty enough to keep even big dogs from crawling into the front seat.</p>\n<p>One of the good things about this type of tether design is that you can leave it latched in your car&#8217;s seat belt and don&#8217;t have to remove it each time you take your dog out of the car. That is, until the seat needs to be used by a human.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340326\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340326\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220817/Kurgo_driver_distration_8-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Auggie sits next to Riggins secured with the seatbelt tether.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins sits next to Auggie, who is secured with the seat belt tether. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>My backseat is almost always a human-free zone, therefore I have two of these tethers attached and ready to go at all times. I&#8217;ve used them on all sorts of dogs, from big to small, from crazy to calm, and all have been able to ride happily and comfortably in the backseat.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the tethers keep me from having to worry about the dogs making their way up to the front seat and me, the driver.</p>\n<h3>Auto Zip Line-Leash/Zip Line Combo</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340321\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340321\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220812/Kurgo_driver_distration_3-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Spencer sits next to Molly who is hooked on the zipline using the Kurgo zip line leash.\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Spencer sits next to Molly, who is hooked on the zip line using the Kurgo zip line leash. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>The Auto Zip Line-Leash/Zip Line Combo is similar to the Seat Belt Tether insomuch as it keeps your dog isolated in the back of the car. The difference is that the zip line goes across the car or car seat and the dog is attached to the line using a removable leash. One end of the leash is attached by carabiner to the zip line, and the other end is attached by carabiner to your dog&#8217;s harness.</p>\n<p>The zip line has<a href=\"http://www.kurgo.com/content/AZL_instr_eng_9-14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> different options</a> for how you secure it to your seat belts or passenger handles. Since my backseat was already occupied, I put the zip line in the cargo area of my car, which I fondly refer to as the &#8220;way back.&#8221; Per the instructions, I looked high and low, literally, for the cargo hooks as described in the product&#8217;s installation instructions. Apparently, the people who designed my 2012 Ford Escape didn&#8217;t feel these hooks were necessary. There are hook-like things in the ceiling covered by plastic things (&#8220;things&#8221; is obviously not the technical word, but it&#8217;s close), and I chose to use those. They looked cargo-hook like. The problem was the S-hook in the zip line was too fat and could only attach to part of the hook. After more searching, it was the only thing I had to use, so I went with it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340323\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340323\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220814/Kurgo_driver_distration_5-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Pepsi can lay down even when hooked in.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pepsi can lie down even when hooked in. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>When the zip line worked, I really liked it. The pups who got to ride in the way back were easy to hook up and had the freedom to stand up, lie down, or even walk back and forth barking at fellow travelers on each side of the car. I wished I had another tether so I could hook up two dogs at once back there.</p>\n<p>Although the goal of the product is to keep the dogs secure while the car is in motion, I found that the item was just as useful at keeping the dogs safe when I opened the back door. It&#8217;s always a struggle for me to lift up the back door while crouching down, hand out, saying &#8220;stay&#8221; over and over again. Then I have to masterfully grab leashes as dogs shoot out of the back like they are starting a race. With the zip line, at least one dog in the way back was secure until I unhooked him.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340322\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340322\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220813/Kurgo_driver_distration_4-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"I found Happy at the driver's seat after he had hoped over the backseat barrier.\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I found Happy at the driver&#8217;s seat after he had hopped over the backseat barrier. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>The problem came when one overanxious dog, Happy, REALLY wanted to be in the front seat. Normally Happy goes in the way back and out the front seat. In his effort to get to his goal of licking my face, he ripped part of the car&#8217;s hook, leaving one end of the zip line not secured.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t tried to fix it yet, but I hope I can reattach it since the product was helpful to me and the pack.</p>\n<h3>Backseat Barrier</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340327\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340327\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220819/Kurgo_driver_distration_9-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Pick-a-boo!\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peekaboo! (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>To say that I failed in my installation of the Backseat Barrier would be an understatement. This is from someone who can actually put together an Ikea piece of furniture without cursing violently and throwing things. Much like the zip line, my car wasn&#8217;t following the rules set by the <a href=\"http://www.kurgo.com/content/BSB_instructions_english_4-15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">installation instructions.</a> I gave up on even reading them and just kept attaching things to other things (again, not the technical name of these items). Kurgo offers support via chat on its website, but because I didn&#8217;t have that kind of patience, I ran inside my house and grabbed a few small carabiners to help out.</p>\n<p>By the time I finished, the barrier was in place and as sturdy as one could expect. I put in the dogs, and within seconds one had easily climbed over the barrier and planted his bum on the passenger seat as if he had called &#8220;shotgun&#8221; before getting in. This was a continuous issue with all of the big dogs in my pack, like Riggins. In fact, for dogs like Riggins, having the barrier was actually worse than not having it since it became harder to push them back to their own seats when they were straddling the barrier.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_340324\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-340324\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10220815/Kurgo_driver_distration_6-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Riggins stares at the barrier planning how to get over it (I was able to secure the barrier higher after this picture was taken). \" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riggins stares at the barrier, planning how to get over it. I was able to secure the barrier higher after this picture was taken. (Photo by Wendy Newell)</p></div>\n<p>When I had tiny little Chloe, a small member of the pack, in the backseat, the barrier worked great for her. The sweet bundle of fur would much prefer to ride on my lap, but was unable to navigate up and over the barrier. It also stopped the big dogs with the seat belt tethers from putting their heads on the armrest and licking my arm &#8212; which happens more than you would expect.</p>\n<h3>Dogster scorecard</h3>\n<p><strong>Quality:</strong> Kurgo&#8217;s quality is always something you can count on.<br />\n<strong>Style:</strong> The basic color of the products can blend in with any car interior.<br />\n<strong>Function:</strong> When used as a tool against driver distraction, the seat belt tether and zip line do what they should: keep the pups away from the driver. The barrier works with small dogs or when used in conjunction with one of the other two products. On its own with large dogs, it hinders more than helps.<br />\n<strong>Creativity:</strong> These are similar to other products on the market, although I&#8217;ve always liked the Kurgo brand for its quality and customer service.<br />\n<strong>Value:</strong> At $13 for the Direct to Seat Belt Tether and $25 for the Auto Zip Line-Leash/Zip Line Combo, these are good solutions for improving driving safety. The $45 Backseat Barrier is worth it if you have the right dog and car for the product to work well.</p>\n<h3>Bottom line</h3>\n<p>Keeping the occupants of your vehicle safe starts with the driver being able to focus on the road. Products like these three from Kurgo are worth any amount of money if they keep you from having an accident.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more Dogster Reviews:</i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/riggins-and-friends-review-the-adventure-dog-heeler-first-aid-kit\">Riggins and Friends Review the Adventure Dog Heeler First Aid Kit</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/sydney-and-sassy-get-their-puppy-nails-cut-with-the-zen-clipper\">Sydney and Sassy Get Their Puppy Nails Cut With the Zen Clipper</a></strong></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/finley-the-vizsla-tries-the-rein-coat-calming-pet-harness\">Finley the Vizsla Tries the Rein Coat Calming Pet Harness</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b><i>About the author: </i></b><a href=\"http://wendyandriggins.com/\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Wendy Newell</i></span></a><i> is a former VP of Sales turned Grade A Dog Sitter.

Even as a child, she had a heart for helping others and a love for animals. &#8220;I saw that children had a need for love, and that dogs had a need for love,&#8221; she recalls, &#8220;and I thought there should be some way for those two to come together to help each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While living in Atlanta, Grace realized that gangs were &#8220;buying&#8221; elementary students for as little as $1. They would pay these children to rob houses or break into cars, knowing that such small children wouldn&#8217;t be sent to jail. One day, shortly after losing her job due to an injury, Grace witnessed a gang making kids fight each other. She broke it up, and told the smallest kids to go home. One child said that he couldn&#8217;t; he was locked out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when I realized that there was a big problem in my neighborhood,&#8221; she says. There wasn&#8217;t anything for kids to do, or anywhere for them to go. Oftentimes, their parents locked them out of their houses while they worked, forcing kids as young as 4 years old to be protected by their older siblings on the streets.</p>\n<p>Because of her injury, Grace was struggling to properly care for her dogs, so she invited some of these kids into her home if they were good with animals. That&#8217;s when she saw the potential for therapy. Her childhood dream of being able to help animals while teaching children compassion, ethics, hard work, and integrity had now become a reality, and <a href=\"http://W-Underdogs.org\" target=\"_blank\">W-Underdogs </a>was born. It was December, 2012.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_339485\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-339485 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29174006/gracie-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"gracie\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grace Hamlin at work. (Photo courtesy Grace Hamlin)</p></div>\n<p>The W-Underdogs mission is to lift up disadvantaged children by having them help rescue animals. Grace teaches kids to manage, care for, and train dogs and cats and vet them as needed. Grace expects the kids to respect adults and each other as well as the animals. &#8220;They have to earn the privilege of being in the program. We expect the kids to show basic kindness to other people and animals for starters,&#8221; she explains.</p>\n<p>Once in the program, kids are ranked much like the Boy or Girl Scouts program, with different levels offering more opportunities. The ranking system measures youth growth in areas of respect and responsibility, and provides a standard for recognition of their achievements. The program also requires parental involvement in the child&#8217;s growth through the program. The overall goal of the W-Underdogs is to address the challenges that disadvantaged kids face and provide them with the skills and sense of accomplishment to help overcome these issues, resulting in a better community environment.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_339494\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-339494\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29174228/kids2.jpg\" alt=\"kids2\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the many kids and dogs W-Underdogs has helped. (Photo courtesy Grace Hamlin)</p></div>\n<p>In addition to helping children, Grace and the W-Underdogs help animals in need. Whether these animals are surrendered to Grace (instead of a shelter) or they&#8217;re strays rescued from the streets, the kids are responsible for their care and training. Children at the lowest ranking clean up after the animals, learning responsibility, discipline, and compassion. They eventually work their way up to earn &#8220;field trips&#8221; where they learn accountability and job skills, and help with animal rescues. In learning to care for the animals, the kids learn to care for themselves and have compassion for others. They learn teamwork and how to manage the expectations of others.</p>\n<p>Grace also teaches the kids to use materials salvaged from the neighborhood or their own backyards to make shelters for dogs and cats who don&#8217;t have any. Many people in her neighborhood own dogs, but tie them up in the backyard and don&#8217;t provide a doghouse for them to get out of the hot summer sun or the cold winter nights. &#8220;A lot of the people where I live don&#8217;t know about basic dog care. They don&#8217;t think that what they&#8217;re doing is wrong,&#8221; she explains. The W-Underdogs both build and donate shelters for these animals, teaching the owners basic pet care and the importance of shelter, clean water, and proper food.</p>\n<p>When new animals are brought into Grace&#8217;s program, the kids have full hands-on training, rehabilitating the dogs from their neglected, abused situations into loving, manageable pets. When these dogs and cats are ready for adoption, the kids take them to rescue events to help get them adoptive families. Saving the animals, in effect, rescues the kids.</p>\n<p>Grace hears positive feedback from parents and teachers of kids in the W-Underdogs program. The kids&#8217; self esteem is high, their grades are better, and their whole attitudes have changed. These kids are now looking at futures that could include a college education, when before their best hope was joining a gang.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_339491\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-339491 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29174217/house-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"house\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A new dog home on its way to a pup in need. (Photo courtesy Grace Hamlin)</p></div>\n<p>Grace teaches the kids job skills and likes them to be their own advocate by the time they&#8217;re in high school. Under Grace&#8217;s supervision, kids can earn money doing landscaping, small engine repair, dog walking, or poop scooping. &#8220;No job is too small. We&#8217;ll take anything we can get,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>The money from these jobs goes into a fund to help pay for animal care and supplies. Older students can bid larger jobs, and their money goes into a personal account set up by the W-Underdogs program to go toward a college education someday. The hardworking and responsible W-Underdogs are always looking for jobs to help fund the program and keep them busy after school. Their work is guaranteed to be as professional as the competition at a more reasonable price, and any work done by the W-Underdogs is a tax deduction.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_339495\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-339495 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/29174230/kids1-600x601.jpg\" alt=\"kids1\" width=\"600\" height=\"601\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Members of W-Underdogs. (Photo courtesy Grace Hamlin)</p></div>\n<p>The W-Underdogs is a nonprofit organization currently based out of Grace&#8217;s home. Grace is looking for a facility that will allow her and the kids to house the dogs and cats in their care as well as be a hangout for the kids after school, so that the group will not be so limited in the number of animals and kids that they help. &#8220;Right now we meet in my house, and I&#8217;m busting at the seams. I can&#8217;t take in any more kids or dogs at this point.&#8221; The program is just starting its third year, but it already has a vision of seeing W-Underdogs in many cities across America, giving kids hope and animals new life.</p>\n<p>To learn more about this amazing group, check out the <a title=\"W-Underdogs Facebook page\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WNDRDOGS\" target=\"_blank\">W-Underdogs Facebook page</a>.

              "<p>Responsible soon-to-be pet parents <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\">research which dog breed</a> is right for them. Whether adopting a shelter dog or buying a puppy from <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/responsible-dog-breeders-and-hobby-breeders\" target=\"_blank\">a reputable breeder</a>, it&#8217;s important to know whether or not that dog will be a good fit. It&#8217;s no wonder, then, that people on the street make assumptions about owners based on the dog breed at the end of their leash.</p>\n<p>Here is what your dog’s breed says about you!</p>\n<h3>1. Labrador Retrievers</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340670\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-340670 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12152638/shutterstock_255387970-1-600x347.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_255387970 (1)\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-290693468/stock-photo-in-the-garden.html?src=APaPQmMl-68xSWoCmGfV-Q-1-18\">Labrador Retrievers</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>No dog says “Middle America” like a <a title=\"Labrador Retriever\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Labrador_Retriever\" target=\"_blank\">Labrador Retriever</a>! The American nuclear family is not complete without 2.5 kids, a minivan, and a Lab. The statistics bear this out: The Lab has been the most popular breed in the United States for 24 years, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC). Whether the type is black, yellow, or chocolate, <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/labrador-retriever-dog-breeds\" target=\"_blank\">the Lab is known for being friendly and intelligent </a>— or hyperactive and goofy, depending on your point of view. And, for some reason, they are popular among hardware store owners who like to bring their dogs to work. (Am I the only one who has noticed that?)</p>\n<p>With only the occasional <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Marley-Me-Life-Worlds-Worst/dp/0060817097\">Marley</a> to portray them as disobedient, the Lab’s reputation as a tolerant, intelligent breed, who prefers snoozing by the fireplace to chasing squirrels, makes it the dog of choice for stressed-out parents and other people who want an “easy” dog. (This can backfire if the affable Lab gets bored and starts eating your couch or relentlessly demands a game of fetch, of course.)</p>\n<p>People who aren’t Lab enthusiasts see the dogs a bit differently. Labs are the station wagon of dogs: Reliable and family friendly, but not very exciting. On the bright side, though, people will assume you are as friendly and approachable as your pooch.</p>\n<h3>2. German Shepherd</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-340672 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12152948/shutterstock_94638259-600x398.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_94638259\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" /></p>\n<p>Do you like your house to run with the precision of a Swiss watch? Do you want a dog who will not only protect your home, but clean it, too? Well, then the <a title=\"German Shepherd\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/German_Shepherd\" target=\"_blank\">German Shepherd </a>is the dog for you.</p>\n<p>The second most popular breed in America, <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breeds-german-shepherd-brains-brawn-star-quality\" target=\"_blank\">the German Shepherd is known for being especially intelligent</a> and loyal, and for working in … well, almost every profession. From guiding the blind to taking down criminals, the Shepherd does it all. It has often been said that the Shepherd’s original breeders were literally trying to make the perfect dog, capable of doing any task. So don’t be surprised if your neighbors think you’re a bit of a perfectionist.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lPeLAkafz1c?rel=0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Alternately, this versatile dog can often be seen as the canine equivalent of a gate at the end of your driveway, warning strangers not to approach your house or your family. They may even assume you don a bite suit on a regular basis to train your dog to go all K-9 on intruders! Long story short, people won’t want to mess with you.</p>\n<h3>3. Bulldog</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-340676\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12154513/shutterstock_346459208-600x401.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_346459208\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /></p>\n<p>The <a title=\"Bulldog\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Bulldog\" target=\"_blank\">Bulldog’s</a> popularity is soaring. The dog is now the third most popular breed in the U.S., according to the AKC. This is mystifying to many, as the dogs are known for being stubborn, hard to train, and riddled with health problems. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-breed-breeds-bulldog\" target=\"_blank\">They are also adorable,</a> and make strangers want to pinch their cheeks. As such, these are the perfect dogs for bachelors!</p>\n<p>If there’s a Bulldog in your house, I’m willing to bet you’re a relatively young, single man — or at least you were when you first got your dog. Breathing problems keep this breed from demanding much in the way of exercise, but still get you plenty of attention from the ladies in the park! Am I right, fellas?</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget just how cute they look on game day in your favorite team’s jersey! If you need a buddy who will hang out on the couch, help you pick up women, and won’t demand long runs on the weekends, then you’re probably a Bulldog fan.</p>\n<h3>4. Australian Cattle Dog</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340677\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-340677 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12154807/shutterstock_90895718-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_90895718\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=90895718&amp;src=id\">Australian Cattle Dog</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>When you bring home your <a title=\"Australian Cattle Dog\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Australian_Cattle_Dog\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Cattle Dog</a>, you need to be prepared for a number of reactions from your neighbors. First and foremost, people are wondering, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; In many parts of the country &#8212; and the globe &#8212; these dogs are virtually unknown, so when people see someone walking these spotted, big-eared, <a title=\"Dingo\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Dingo\" target=\"_blank\">Dingo</a>-like dogs down a suburban street, they may think you are some sort of post-apocalyptic road warrior traveling the world with his dog (a la Mel Gibson in <em>Mad Max</em>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/australian-cattle-dog-breeds-dogs\" target=\"_blank\">People who are more familiar with the breed</a> &#8212; and who realize you are probably not a cattle rancher &#8212; may assume that you spend most of your weekends traversing rugged terrain with your dog by your side. Your neighbor thinks that every time you load the dog into the back of your car, you are heading off to summit a mountain or whitewater raft down a river.</p>\n<p>Of course, people who really know the breed know that ACDs tend to love order in their world. They&#8217;re known for putting their toys away and enforcing house rules on everyone from the kids to the other animals. So if you&#8217;ve chosen this particular breed to share your life, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re as Type A as your dog.</p>\n<h3>5. Mutt</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_340679\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-340679 size-medium\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12155340/shutterstock_144150163-600x399.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_144150163\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=144150163&amp;src=id\">Mixed-breed dog</a> by Shutterstock.</p></div>\n<p>It’s hard to make generalizations about people who love mutts. After all, the beauty of mutts is that <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/topic/mixed-breeds/\" target=\"_blank\">each one is unique</a>. A Retriever mix is different than a <a title=\"Chihuahua\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Chihuahua\" target=\"_blank\">Chihuahua </a>mix. A <a title=\"Border Collie\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Border_Collie\" target=\"_blank\">Border Collie</a> mix is different than a Terrier mix. But here’s one thing people are thinking about you whenever you walk down the street with that mystery mutt: “What a saint!”</p>\n<p>The more unidentifiable your dog’s breed is, the more easygoing and good-hearted you are! You probably spend all your spare time volunteering! After all, no one but a do-gooder would take in a dog with an unknown background and no information about breed traits to fall back on, right?</p>\n<p>Of course, other mutt lovers know that isn’t true. They know that you’re just sensible. If you want a dog that is even-tempered, long-lived, and won’t break the bank, it’s hard to do better than a good ol’ mutt. You probably also wear sensible shoes, clip coupons, and drive a Prius because that just makes sense.</p>\n<p>Tell us all about your dogs and how they do or do not defy the stereotypes in the comments!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b><i>Read more by </i></b><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/author/theresa-cramer/\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Theresa Cramer</i></b></span></a><b><i>: </i></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-ive-learned-about-my-cattle-dog-from-unexpected-sources\"><b>What I’ve Learned About My Cattle Dog From Unexpected Sources</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/my-dog-got-into-yale\"><b>My Dog Got Into Yale!</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p2\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/when-your-dog-goes-missing-how-long-do-you-hold-out-hope\"><b>When Your Dog Goes Missing, How Long Do You Hold Out Hope?</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p5\"><b><i>About the author:</i></b><i> Theresa Cramer is a journalist and editor by trade, an NPR addict, and an avid gardener.

At best estimate, 578,424 Americans were homeless in 2014 (based on the government-sponsored count conducted each January), and it’s estimated that 1.7 million youth will experience homelessness at some point throughout the year, with approximately 380,000 youth remaining homeless for a extended period of time.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-338028 alignright\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/10144453/Dogster_Heroes_award1_small_19_0_0_3_1_011.png\" alt=\"Dogster_Heroes_award1_small_19_0_0_3_1_01\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p>The epidemic of homelessness, and particularly youth homelessness in this country, is a really important issue to me. <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-health-behavior-training-homeless-teen-mercury\" target=\"_blank\">I was kicked out of home when I was 17. </a>I was really lucky to be able to couch surf through my senior year in high school, but my closest friends were living on the streets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-training-addict-dogster-sassafras-lowrey\" target=\"_blank\">Until I became homeless, I was a serous dog agility competitor, </a>but once I lost my home (and family), I had no choice but to make the devastating choice to rehome my dogs. Now, many years later, I’m so thrilled to have this opportunity to highlight the exceptional work of <a title=\"Collide NYC!\" href=\"http://www.collidenyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Collide NYC</a>. This 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization provides much-needed services, resources, and support for the pets of young homeless people; it is definitely a <a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/topic/dogster-heroes/\" target=\"_blank\">Dogster Hero</a>!</p>\n<p>Housed at Graffiti Church in New York City’s East Village, Collide NYC commits to recognizing, as it says in its mission statement, “the critical role companion animals play in the overall well-being of their owners, as they offer emotional support, stability, and unconditional love. We believe all creatures are valuable, and for us, that means compassion extends from the end of the leash to the hand that holds it.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342183\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342183 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24152337/CollideFacebook3-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"CollideFacebook3\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Collide NYC client. (Photo courtesy Colide NYC)</p></div>\n<p>Extremely limited resources exist for the pets of young homeless people in NYC (or for any age, anywhere in the country, really). Collide NYC provides dogs with high-quality and nutritious food, snacks, leashes, harnesses, toys, and all other supplies they need to be happy, warm, and healthy on the streets with their humans. I had the chance to talk with Collide NYC&#8217;s founder Heidi Powers about the organization and the clients it serves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it’s so important for people to understand there are many reasons people end up on the streets, and many reasons they stay. It can be so difficult for those with no or limited experience with this work to comprehend how it happens,&#8221; explains Powers. &#8220;I was a hairstylist before starting C<span class=\"il\">ollide</span> and had a pretty &#8216;normal&#8217; life. &#8230; I had no idea. And, some people simply don’t want to know because the truth can be hard to hear and hard to reconcile with why some things happen to some people and not to others.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342179\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342179 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24152125/CollideFacebook2-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"CollideFacebook2\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Collide NYC client. (Photo courtesy Colide NYC)</p></div>\n<p>Collide NYC’s services also include drop-in support that provides clients with supplies for their dogs, and a family style meal on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for human and animals. It also facilitates a free spay/neuter program as well as preventative and ongoing veterinary care. Its clinic, staffed with <a title=\"Humane Society of New York\" href=\"http://www.humanesocietyny.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Humane Society of New York</a> support, offers legally required vaccinations and city dog licenses, and addresses any pressing medical needs the dogs have, including X-rays, surgery, and medication. It also continues to support the veterinary needs of clients who are transitioning off the streets and into stable housing.</p>\n<p>Because the city&#8217;s homeless community, particularly the number of people with animal companions, differs season to season due to many people leaving the area during harsh winter months, Collide NYC is most active during spring, summer, and fall. This winter, the organization is providing on-site services on an on-call basis as clients express need, and it also has expanded veterinary services at a partnering site.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-342392\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/26094757/CollideFacebook5-600x8001-600x639.jpg\" alt=\"A Collide NYC client. (Photo courtesy Colide NYC)\" width=\"600\" height=\"639\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Collide NYC client. (Photo courtesy Colide NYC)</p></div>\n<p>In talking about its winter services, Powers says, &#8220;I am the only one here for winter other than John, who helps me do distributions, deliveries, and door security on an on-call basis. I hire our sober clients, and they all leave town for the winter, as they live in vehicles, etc. We have always run C<span class=\"il\">ollide</span> in seasonal segments, reevaluating and adjusting the program as we go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An ongoing housing and shelter crisis exists in NYC, with many youth having to be on lengthy wait lists just to access an emergency shelter bed. But those beds aren’t even options for homeless people with dogs because pets aren’t allowed in any of the city shelters. As a result, many who see their dogs as family members have no choice but to remain outside in order to keep their family together. This is just one reason on top of the extremely limited housing options that makes the possibility of transitioning off the streets incredibly daunting.</p>\n<p>Collide NYC is one of the very few resources that exist to support the direct needs of homeless companion animals and their young people. Dog lovers interested in supporting this effort can <a title=\"make a financial donation\" href=\"http://www.collidenyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">make a financial donation</a> or purchase from its regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3NAGTQGCZ79ZN/ref=cm_sw_su_w\">Amazon wish list</a>, which reflects current needs for items like harnesses, dog coats, treats, and toys.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342181\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-342181 size-large\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24152206/CollideFacebook4-600x834.jpg\" alt=\"CollideFacebook4\" width=\"600\" height=\"834\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Collide NYC client. (Photo courtesy Colide NYC)</p></div>\n<p>In talking about her role and the shifting climate of working with homeless communities in NYC, Powers explains, &#8220;We try very hard to be the best stewards possible of monies and supplies given, so that donors have a good understanding of how we work and feel good about their contribution. Homelessness is always present, but the areas open to those on the street, the police presence, the public support, and the agencies that assist are constantly changing. Neighborhoods gentrify, squats get turned into high-dollar developments, and the community starts to complain. Multiply that by a million when there is an animal involved.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For many of us, our dogs are the most important members of our family &#8212; they are our babies, they are who we turn to for comfort, support, and companionship when we are struggling. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many homeless people have dogs at their sides. Dogs love us unconditionally; they want to be with their people and don’t care if that’s on the street or in a mansion.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-342186\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/24152450/CollideFacebook6-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"CollideFacebook6\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>Everyday in NYC, I pass young people who are living on the streets with their dogs, and those dogs are almost always well behaved, happy, and healthy looking. One of the reasons for that is the fantastic and heroic work done by Collide NYC and its donors and volunteers, who ensure that pets of the homeless get the supplies and veterinary care they need, so they can continue being their people&#8217;s best friends and biggest supporters &#8212; no matter where they live or what the future holds.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><b>Read more Dogster Heroes:</b></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/i-spent-a-day-with-the-sato-project-an-amazing-dog-rescue-in-puerto-rico\"><b>I Spent a Day With The Sato Project, an Amazing Dog Rescue in Puerto Rico</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/hound-sanctuary-aims-to-save-spains-hunting-dogs-from-sure-death\"><b>Hound Sanctuary Aims to Save Spain’s Hunting Dogs From Sure Death</b></a></li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/we-catch-up-with-annie-blumenfeld-a-teen-advocate-for-animal-health\"><b>We Catch Up With Annie Blumenfeld, a Teen Advocate for Animal Health</b></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>About the author:</strong> Sassafras Lowrey is a dog-obsessed author based in Brooklyn.

              "<p>I don’t know about you, but naming a new pet is always one of my favorite parts of the adoption process. My kids enjoy the brainstorm sessions as much as I do. Occasionally, we keep the names our pets had before they came to live with us, but more often we choose new ones.</p>\n<p>Our newest canine family member, brought home recently, ended up being named in honor of my Uncle Bud, a veteran who passed away a few years ago.</p>\n<p>Even though I had been sure I wasn’t going to bring any new pets home, something happened right after I’d written an article about <a title=\"judging people who buy dogs from breeders\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/commentary-i-will-judge-you-for-buying-a-dog-from-a-breeder\" target=\"_blank\">judging people who buy dogs from breeders</a>. In that article, I talked about how much I like <a title=\"Boston Terriers\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Boston_Terrier\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Terriers</a> and <a title=\"French Bulldogs\" href=\"http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/French_Bulldog\" target=\"_blank\">French Bulldogs</a>. Wouldn’t you know it that a cute little Boston Terrier mix showed up for adoption right after at one of my favorite shelters, <a title=\"Yakima Humane Society\" href=\"http://www.yakimahumane.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Yakima Humane Society</a>?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341277\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341277\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17174337/Buddy-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"Buddy on adoption day! Photo by Zinnia Willingham.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Buddy on adoption day! (Photo by Zinnia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>The cute little Boston Terrier mix was listed under the name of Spud. I suppose he did look kind of like a little potato. I started thinking, <em>well, maybe one more dog wouldn’t hurt.</em></p>\n<p>Veteran’s Day was coming up, so I decided that if Spud was still available on my day off, I would drive over there and apply to adopt him if it felt like a match.</p>\n<p>The afternoon before, I called to see if he was still there.</p>\n<p>“Actually, someone called and said they think it’s their dog, so he he’ll probably be going home tonight,” the adoption coordinator said.</p>\n<p>“What if they don’t get him? Is there a way you can let me know?”</p>\n<p>“If he’s still listed on the website in the morning, that will mean he is still here,” she replied.</p>\n<p>First thing in the morning, I checked. Indeed, the little guy was still listed.</p>\n<p>“Are we going to get the puppy today?” my son asked.</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, we already have enough dogs. I’m not sure it’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“But he needs a home!”</p>\n<p>With that, we packed our dogs into the minivan and departed. My kids and I always enjoy the drive from Seattle to Yakima. We decided the adventure to see if we could adopt Spud would be worth it, regardless of the outcome.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341271\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341271\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17173922/Seattle-to-Yakima-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Driving from Seattle to Yakima.

He cuddled right up to me upon meeting me. It was a done deal.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341274\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341274\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17174132/Buddy-at-our-meet-and-greet-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Buddy with my son Justin during our meet and greet.

(Photo by Zinnia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>On the drive home, my kids and I discussed what we should name the new dog.</p>\n<p>“What about Bud? Like Uncle Bud?”</p>\n<p>My Uncle Bud passed away a few years ago. His real name was John Wayne Willingham, and I didn’t have contact with him for most of my life, due to family estrangement, but we reconnected after my dad died in 2005.</p>\n<p>Uncle Bud lived down South. He spoke with a southern drawl and had a rough early life but found redemption in Christianity near the end. Uncle Bud served in the military before working his entire career as both a police officer and a security guard. There were family stories about him wrestling alligators in Florida as a young man. But what I loved most about Uncle Bud was his sensitivity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341323\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341323\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18084014/Buddy-and-me-in-car-600x672.jpg\" alt=\"Buddy cuddles. Photo by Kezia Willingham.\" width=\"600\" height=\"672\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Buddy cuddles. (Photo by Kezia Willingham)</p></div>\n<p>Both of my children are of mixed ethnicity. At the time I was talking with Uncle Bud, I was married to an undocumented immigrant originally from Honduras. As most people know, there is a lot of anti-immigrant sentiment in this country. Uncle Bud sometimes shared things on Facebook and in emails that were not exactly pro-immigrant or pro-mixed race. However, the thing I will remember most about him is his apology for doing so and his realization that it might bother me.</p>\n<p>One day he sent an email message saying he was sorry if he’d said or shared anything that offended me or my family. I appreciated his thoughtfulness. In a time when families become alienated due to racism or other oppressive beliefs, Uncle Bud &#8212; this old, Southern white man &#8212; apologized to me, his city-living tattooed-niece raising mixed-ethnicity kids and married to an undocumented immigrant. That took balls.</p>\n<p>Just like Uncle Bud, my dog Buddy has balls, too (not literally). He has swagger that none of my other dogs have. He’d take on a semi-truck if he could. He’s the most brazen of our pack, but he’s also sensitive, too, cuddling up with his mama, so sweet, every night.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_341279\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-341279\" src=\"http://d30nr4b2k915ua.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/17174641/Me-and-Buddy-600x800.jpg\" alt=\"Selfie with Buddy.
